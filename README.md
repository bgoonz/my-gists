### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/alt-web-dev-setup.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/alt-web-dev-setup.md)


Being a developer isn't just hacking away into the wee hours of the morning or debugging a new feature. In order to become a well-rounded developer we should also understand what tools we need and a minimum understanding of how they work. This includes setting up our computers for development.

Here at App Academy we work with a Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, and PostgresSQL stack. A [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) is simply a collection of software and hardware used in development of an application. For our specific purposes we are using Ruby on Rails on the backend/server, PostgresSQL to house our database, and JavaScript + React + Redux for frontend rendering and logic.

As we progress through the course you will be prompted to complete a few installation and configuration steps to get your personal machine ready for the next phase.

## Phase 0: Preparing your machine

Here we will install basic developer tools, such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a 3rd party package manager for MacOS), Xcode (a library of developer tools provided by Apple), git (a version control system we will be using throughout the course), and VS Code (a full-featured text-editor).

### Chrome

Here at App Academy, our browser of choice is Google Chrome. This isn't super important at the beginning of the course, but once we get into frontend development the Chrome Devtools (think frontend debugging) are going to play a very important role.

To install, download from the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and install.

#### Optional for In Person Students App Academy Chrome Tab

We have a custom Chrome Extension for new tabs that provides a dashboard with links to the curriculum, relevant documentation, and, once your cohort starts, links to the day's projects, readings, and homework.

This is not required, but feel free to give it a try. To install, follow the installation instructions on the [App Academy Chrome Tab Repo](https://github.com/appacademy/app-academy-chrome-tab).

### Xcode

Let's start with Xcode. The Xcode command line tools are a requirement for installing the homebrew package manager in the next step.

**NOTE: If you are using a Linux machine you will not be able to install Xcode or homebrew. Instead please follow [these git installation directions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and then [these rbenv installation directions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout) (up to and including "Installing Ruby versions") to download rbenv using git. Once you are finished, skip to the section on Git and ignore all commands involving homebrew.**

Install the Xcode command line tools by running the following from the console.

    $ xcode-select --install

To conclude the installation you will need to agree to the Xcode license. Start the Xcode app, click "Agree", and allow the installation to finish. Then you can go ahead and quit the Xcode app.

### Homebrew

Homebrew is kind of like a low-tech App Store. It allows us access to and the ability to install a wide variety of software and command line tools from the console. These are distinct from those hosted on the App Store and will need to be managed by Homebrew.

Enter the following in your terminal to download and install Homebrew:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You will be given a list of dependencies that will be installed and prompted to continue or abort. Press `RETURN` to continue.

Let's break this command down a bit. `curl`, a command-line tool commonly used for downloading files from the internet, is used to download the Homebrew installation file. The `"$(...)"` transforms the file content into a string. Finally, the string is passed to our Ruby executable (`/usr/bin/ruby` is where this the system Ruby executable file is stored on our machine) with the `-e` flag to tell Ruby to run the argument as code.

Check out the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) to learn the basic commands.

### Git

Git is a version control system that allows us to track, commit and revert changes to files within a directory. Here we will install it and add global user info.

    # install git
    brew install git

    # makes git terminal output pretty
    git config --global color.ui true

    # this will mark you as the 'author' of each committed change
    git config --global user.name "your name here"

    # use the email associated with your GitHub account
    git config --global user.email your_email_here

### VS Code

This one is pretty easy. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then download and install VS Code.

To verify that the shell commands were installed correctly, run `which code` in your terminal. If `code` is not a recognized command, open the VS Code editor, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS ,`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux) and type `shell command` to find the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command. Then restart the terminal. This allows you to easily open files in VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command followed by a file or directory.

Next, we'll want to install a few useful VS Code extensions and configure VS Code to play nice with these extensions. Download [this zip file](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/setup_vscode_master.zip), which contains a scripts that will do the work for you. Unzip the file and open the `setup_vscode` directory. Then open that directory in the terminal (drag and drop it over the terminal icon on macOS or right click in the directory and select `Open in Terminal` on most Linux distributions). To run the script, type `./setup_vscode.sh`. The script will do the rest. Simply restart VS Code and you'll be good to go. (Note that there's a second script, called `setup_vscode_linter.sh`. We can't run this script yet but will do so in due time.)

## Phase 1: Ruby

Here we will be setting up Ruby with the help of [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), a Ruby environment manager. We like rbenv because it allows us to switch between versions of Ruby easily and setup default versions to use within project directories. This will install instances of Ruby in addition to the system version, which comes pre-installed.

### Rbenv + Ruby

First we will install rbenv, then use it to install our desired version of Ruby.

    # install rbenv
    brew install rbenv

    # add to the PATH (rbenv commands are now available from terminal)
    # .bashrc is the file that contains all of our terminal settings
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # initialize rbenv everytime you open a new console window (otherwise our system ruby version will take over when we start a new terminal session)
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # update current console window with new settings
    source ~/.bashrc

    # source .bashrc from .bash_profile (necessary on some machines)
    echo 'source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile

    # install Ruby version 2.5.1
    rbenv install 2.5.1

    # set version 2.5.1 to be our global default
    rbenv global 2.5.1

    # the 'rehash' command updates the environment to your configuration
    rbenv rehash

    # and let's verify everything is correct
    # check the version
    ruby -v # => 2.5.1

    # check that we are using rbenv (this tells you where the version of ruby you are using is installed)
    which ruby # => /Users/your-username/.rbenv/shims/ruby

### Gems

There are a few gems we will want to access globally.

- Bundler allows us to define project dependencies inside a `Gemfile` and gives us a bunch of commands to update, remove and install them. Check out the [Bundler docs](http://bundler.io/docs.html) for more info.
- Pry is an alternative to the Irb (the default Ruby REPL). It is not only more powerful, but also easier to use than Irb and should be your go-to for running and debugging Ruby code. Check out the [Pry website](http://pryrepl.org/) for more info and a super useful tutorial.
- Byebug is feature-rich debugging tool for Ruby. With Byebug you can halt the execution of your code and inspect/track variables and the flow of execution. Lots of cool features in here, so check out the [Byebug docs](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug)!

Let's install them.

    gem install bundler pry byebug

## Phase 2: Backend Development

For backend development we will need a database application, a server, and a web-application framework.

For the purposes of this course, we will be using two database applications: PostgreSQL and SQLite.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a fast, feature-rich, open-source database application. It is a scalable application that we can use for development and production apps. We will be using PostgreSQL for most of our web-apps.

#### MacOS X

Fortunately for MacOS X, we can use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/), which provides the database application and a command line interface (CLI) so we can interact with it. To install Postgres.app, download and follow the installation instructions from the website.

**Though the instructions say it is optional, it is highly recommended to configure your system `$PATH` so that you can use the command line tools.** We will make extensive use of them in the course.

Paste these commands into the terminal:

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
    echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp

#### Linux

The [Ubuntu wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) can help. See especially "Alternative Server Setup".

### After installation

Close and reopen your terminal to gain access to the `psql` command. Let's try it out.

    # open the PostgreSQL CLI
    psql

    # you should be greeted with a prompt that looks like this
    psql (10.X)
    Type "help" for help.

    yourname=#

    # type '/q' to quit
    yourname=# \q

**NB: You do not need a graphical client for this course. We encourage you to use the CLI as it teaches you the hard way and is the most common way to interact with a database directly.**

### SQLite

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) is a small, lightweight database application that requires no configuration and stores the database as a stand-alone file. For this reason, we will be using SQLite for a few of our in-class projects.

Install using the Brew package manager:

    brew install sqlite

Again, verify that installation was successful by opening the SQLite CLI.

    # open SQLite CLI with this command
    sqlite3

    #  you should see this output
    # SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39
    # Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    # Connected to a transient in-memory database.
    # Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

    # .q to quit
    sqlite> .q

### Rails

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) will serve as our application framework for this course. Rails is a very full-featured, opinionated framework that provides all the tools we need to create a complete web-app. These include an ORM (Object Relational Mapper - essentially we can continue to use Object Oriented Programming with respect to resources in our database), routing, a development server, and a templating engine.

Fortunately for us, Rails is available as a gem in the Ruby ecosystem. Let's install it, specifying the version so that we're all working in sync:

    # install rails
    gem install rails --version 5.2.3
    rbenv rehash
    # verify installation
    which rails # => /Users/username/.rbenv/shims/rails

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### Node.js & NPM

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will be our local JavaScript engine. This is used to run JavaScript code and run associated node commands.

Again, we want to use a version manager with Node to help us manage potential conflicts between versions and dependencies. In this case we will be using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to install/manage Node.js.

    # download and run the official install script
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash

    # update your terminal config (you will now have access to the nvm command)
    source ~/.bashrc

    # install a stable version of node
    nvm install 10.13.0

    # set version 10.13.0 as default version
    nvm use 10.13.0

    # verify install/config
    which node # => /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v10.13.0/bin/node

Node, like Ruby, comes with a package manager called [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), which provides access to a whole ecosystem of libraries and tools we can use. NPM comes pre-bundled with Node, so there is no additional work for us to do. By default we don't need any additional packages installed and will be installing them on a per-project basis.

## **Big O Notation**

- Big O helps gives us a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs.

  - Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches.
  - Helps us debug things easier.
  - It also comes up a lot in interviews!

- An Example: Comparing two functions that calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to n.

```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}
```

> Number of operations will grow with n.
> Would be O(n) or Linear Time.

```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
}
```

> Has three simple operations: 1 Multiplication 1 Addition 1 Division. (Regardless of n)
> Would be O(1) or Constant Time.

- First we need to consider what makes one implementation better than the other?

  - Faster? (Time Complexity);
  - Less Memory Intensive (Space Complexity);
  - More Readable

- How can we measure speed?

  - Timers? (Doesn't work well - not reliable or precise)
  - Instead we should count the number of simple operations.

- Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting.
- An algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant f(n) times, as n increases.
  - f(n) = n (Linear)
  - f(n) = n^2 (Quadratic)
  - f(n) = 1 (Constant)
  - f(n) could be anything!

```js
function countUpAndDown(n) {
  console.log('going up!');
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log('at the top, going down!');
  for (let j = n - 1; j >=0; j--) {
    console.log(j);
  }
  console.log('Back down, bye!);
}
```

> Both loops are O(n) but since we just want the big picture, this entire function would be O(n);

```js
function printAllPairs(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      console.log(i, j);
    }
  }
}
```

> Nested loops are never a good thing when trying to write fast code.
> O(n^2) or Quadratic Time.

- Constants don't matter in big O & Smaller Terms don't matter

  - O(2n) is just O(n) Linear
  - O(500) is just O(1) Constnat
  - O(13n^2) is just O(n^2) Quadratic
  - O(n + 10) is just O(n) Linear
  - O(1000n + 50) is just O(n) Linear
  - O(n^2 + 5n + 8) is just O(n^2) Quadratic

- **`Big O Shorthands`**

  - Arithmetic Operations are Constant
  - Variable assignment is constant
  - Accessing elements in an array (by index) or by object (by key) is constant.
  - In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever is inside of the loop.

- Additional Examples

```js
function logAtLeast5(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.max(5, n); i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

> O(n) Linear Time

```js
function logAtMost5(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.min(5, n); i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

> O(1) Constant Time.

## **A Guide to Big-O Notation**

**Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation**

- Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of calculating time complexity?

  - Not all computers are made equal( some may be stronger and therefore boost our runtime speed )
  - How many background processes ran concurrently with our program that was being tested?
  - We also need to ask if our code remains performant if we increase the size of the input.

- The real question we need to answering is: **`How does our performance scale?`**.

**Big O Notation**

- Big O Notation is a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input arguments.
- Since we use mathematical functions in Big-O, there are a few big picture ideas that we'll want to keep in mind:
  - The function should be defined by the size of the input.
  - **`Smaller`** Big O is better (lower time complexity)
  - Big O is used to describe the worst case scenario.
  - Big O is simplified to show only its most dominant mathematical term.

**Simplifying Math Terms**

- We can use the following rules to simplify the our Big O functions:

  - **`Simplify Products`** : If the function is a product of many terms, we drop the terms that don't depend on n.
  - **`Simplify Sums`** : If the function is a sum of many terms, we drop the non-dominant terms.

- **`n`** : size of the input
- **`T(f)`** : unsimplified math function
- **`O(f)`** : simplified math function.

**`Simplifying a Product`**
| Unsimplified        | Big-O Simplified      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| T(5 _ n^2)          | O(n^2) Quadratic      |
| T(100000 _ n)       | O(n) Linear           |
| T( n / 12)          | O (n) Linear          |
| T( 42 _ n _ log(n)) | O(nlog(n)) Log Linear |
| T(12)               | O(1) Constant         |

**`Simplifying a Sum`**
| Unsimplified     | Big-O Simplified   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| T( n3 + n2 + n ) | O(n^3)             |
| T( log(n) + 2n ) | O(2^n) Exponential |
| T( n + log(n) )  | O(n) Linear        |
| T( n! + 10n )    | O(n!) Polynomial   |

**`Putting it all together`**

| Unsimplified      | Big-O Simplified      |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| T( 5n2 + 99n )    | O(n^2) Quadratic      |
| T( 2n + nlog(n) ) | O(nlog(n)) Log Linear |
| T( 2n + 5n1000)   | O(2^n) Exponential    |

- First we apply the product rule to drop all constants.
- Then we apply the sum rule to select the single most dominant term.

**Common Complexity Classes**

> There are 7 major classes in Time Complexity

| Big O                      | Complexity Class Name                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| O(1)                       | Constant                               |
| O(log(n))                  | Logarithmic                            |
| O(n)                       | Linear                                 |
| O(nlog(n))                 | Loglinear, Linearithmetic, Quasilinear |
| O(nc) - O(n2), O(n3), etc. | Polynomial                             |
| O(cn) - O(2n), O(3n), etc. | Exponential                            |
| O(n!)                      | Factorial                              |

- **`O(1) Constant`**

  - The algorithm takes roughly the same number of steps for any input size.

  ```js
  // O(1)
  function constant1(n) {
    return n * 2 + 1;
  }

  // O(1)
  function constant2(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
  ```

- **`O(log(n)) Logarithmic`**

  - In most cases our hidden base of Logarithmic time is 2, log complexity algo's will typically display 'halving' the size of the input (like binary search!)

  ```js
  // O(log(n))
  function logarithmic1(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return;
    logarithmic1(n / 2);
  }

  // O(log(n))
  function logarithmic2(n) {
    let i = n;
    while (i > 1) {
      i /= 2;
    }
  }
  ```

- **`O(n) Linear`**

  - Linear algo's will access each item of the input "once".

  ```js
  // O(n)
  function linear1(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }

  // O(n), where n is the length of the array
  function linear2(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }

  // O(n)
  function linear3(n) {
    if (n === 1) return;
    linear3(n - 1);
  }
  ```

- **`O(nlog(n)) Log Linear Time`**
  - Combination of linear and logarithmic behavior, we will see features from both classes.
  - Algo's that are log-linear will use both recursion AND iteration.

```js
// O(n * log(n))
function loglinear(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  loglinear(n / 2);
  loglinear(n / 2);
}
```

- **`O(nc) Polynomial`**
  - C is a fixed constant.

```js
// O(n^2)
function quadratic(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {}
  }
}

// O(n^3)
function cubic(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      for (let k = 1; k <= n; k++) {}
    }
  }
}
```

- Example of Quadratic and Cubic runtime.

- **`O(c^n) Exponential`**
  - C is now the number of recursive calls made in each stack frame.
  - Algo's with exponential time are VERY SLOW.

```js
// O(2^n)
function exponential2n(n) {
  if (n === 1) return;
  exponential_2n(n - 1);
  exponential_2n(n - 1);
}

// O(3^n)
function exponential3n(n) {
  if (n === 0) return;
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
}
```

- **`O(n!) Factorial`**
  - The largest/ worst complexity (minus DTIME which is n^n);

---

## **Memoization**

- **Memoization** : a design pattern used to reduce the overall number of calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive strategies to solve.
  - MZ stores the results of the sub-problems in some other data structure, so that we can avoid duplicate calculations and only 'solve' each problem once.
  - Two features that comprise memoization:
    - 1. FUNCTION MUST BE RECURSIVE.
    - 2. Our additional DS is usually an object (we refer to it as our memo!)

**Memoizing Factorial**

```js
let memo = {};

function factorial(n) {
  // if this function has calculated factorial(n) previously,
  // fetch the stored result in memo
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n === 1) return 1;

  // otherwise, it havs not calculated factorial(n) previously,
  // so calculate it now, but store the result in case it is
  // needed again in the future
  memo[n] = n * factorial(n - 1);
  return memo[n];
}

factorial(6); // => 720, requires 6 calls
factorial(6); // => 720, requires 1 call
factorial(5); // => 120, requires 1 call
factorial(7); // => 5040, requires 2 calls

memo; // => { '2': 2, '3': 6, '4': 24, '5': 120, '6': 720, '7': 5040 }
```

- Our memo object is _mapping_ out our arguments of factorial to it's return value.
  - Keep in mind we didn't improve the speed of our algo.

**Memoizing Fibonacci**
![memofib](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/memoization/images/fib_memoized.png)

- Our time complexity for fibonacci goes from O(2^n) to O(n) after applying memoization.

**The Memoization Formula**

> Rules

1. Write the unoptimized brute force recursion (make sure it works);
2. Add memo object as an additional arugmnt .
3. Add a base case condition that returns the stored value if the function's argument is in the memo.
4. Before returning the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a value and make the function's argument it's key.

> Things to remember

1. When solving DP problems with Memoization, it is helpful to draw out the visual tree first.
2. When you notice duplicate sub-tree's that means we can memoize.

---

## \*\*

```js
function fastFib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;

  memo[n] = fastFib(n - 1, memo) + fastFib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

fastFib(6); // => 8
fastFib(50); // => 12586269025
```

---

## **Tabulation**

- **Tabulation Strategy**
  - Use When:
    - The function is iterative and not recursive.
    - The accompanying DS is usually an array.

```js
function fib(n) {
  let mostRecentCalcs = [0, 1];

  if (n === 0) return mostRecentCalcs[0];

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    const [secondLast, last] = mostRecentCalcs;
    mostRecentCalcs = [last, secondLast + last];
  }

  return mostRecentCalcs[1];
}
```

- Steps for tabulation
  - Create a table array based off the size of the input.
  - Initialize some values in the table to 'answer' the trivially small subproblem.
  - Iterate through the array and fill in the remaining entries.
  - Your final answer is usually the last entry in the table.

# **Memo and Tab Demo with Fibonacci**

```js
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

> Normal Recursive Fibonacci

```js
function fibMemo(n, memo = { 0: 0, 1: 1 }) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];

  memo[n] = fibMemo(n - 1) + fibMemo(n - 2);
  return memo[n];
}
```

> Memoization Fibonacci 1

```js
function fib(n, memo) {
  memo = memo || {};

  if (memo[n]) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  return (memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo));
}
```

> Memoization Fibonacci 2

```js
function tabFib(n) {
  let table = new Array(n);

  table[0] = 0;
  table[1] = 1;
  table[2] = 1;

  for (i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2];
    console.log(table);
  }

  return table[n];
}
```

> Tabulated Fibonacci

# **Class Examples**

## **Example of Linear Search**

```js
function search(array, term) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] === term) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

- Worst Case Scenario: The term does not even exist in the array.
- Meaning: If it doesn't exist then our for loop would run until the end therefore making our time complexity O(n).

## **Example of Binary Search**

```js
function binarySearch(arr, x, start, end) {
  if (start > end) return false;

  let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
  if (arr[mid] === x) return true;

  if (arr[mid] > x) {
    return binarySearch(arr, x, start, mid - 1);
  } else {
    return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
  }
}
```

- Must be conducted on a sorted array.
- Binary search is logarithmic time, not exponential b/c n is cut down by two, not growing.
- Binary Search is part of Divide and Conquer.

## **Example of Merge Sort**

```js
function merge(leftArray, rightArray) {
  const sorted = [];
  while (letArray.length > 0 && rightArray.length > 0) {
    const leftItem = leftArray[0];
    const rightItem = rightArray[0];

    if (leftItem > rightItem) {
      sorted.push(rightItem);
      rightArray.shift();
    } else {
      sorted.push(leftItem);
      leftArray.shift();
    }
  }

  while (leftArray.length !== 0) {
    const value = leftArray.shift();
    sorted.push(value);
  }

  while (rightArray.length !== 0) {
    const value = rightArray.shift();
    sorted.push(value);
  }

  return sorted;
}

function mergeSort(array) {
  const length = array.length;
  if (length === 1) {
    return array;
  }

  const middleIndex = Math.ceil(length / 2);
  const leftArray = array.slice(0, middleIndex);
  const rightArray = array.slice(middleIndex, length);

  leftArray = mergeSort(leftArray);
  rightArray = mergeSort(rightArray);

  return merge(leftArray, rightArray);
}
```

---

## **Example of Bubble Sort**

```js
function bubbleSort(items) {
  let length = items.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < length - i - 1; j++) {
      if (items[j] > items[j + 1]) {
        let tmp = items[j];
        items[j] = items[j + 1];
        items[j + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Worst Case & Best Case are always the same because it makes nested loops.
- Double for loops are polynomial time complexity or more specifically in this case Quadratic big O O(n^2);
# **Notes**

## **Sorting Algorithms**

## **Bubble Sort**

- The first major sorting algorithm one learns in introductory programming courses.
- Gives an intro on how to convert unsorted data into sorted data.
- It's almost never used in production code because:
  - It's not efficient
  - It's not commonly used
  - There is stigma attached to it
- **`Bubbling Up`** : Term that infers that an item _is in motion_, _moving in some direction_, and _has some final resting destination_.

- Bubble sort, sorts an array of integers by bubbling the largest integer to the top.
  ![bubble](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/naive_sorting_algorithms/bubble_sort/images/BubbleSort.gif)

```js
// Bubble Sort
function bubble(array) {
  let sorted = true;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    let num1 = array[i];
    let num2 = array[i + 1];
    if (num1 > num2) {
      array[i + 1] = num1;
      array[i] = num2;
      sorted = false;
    }
  }
  if (sorted) {
    return array;
  } else {
    return bubble(array);
  }
}
```

## **Selection Sort**

- Selection sort organizes the smallest elements to the start of the array.
  ![selection](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/naive_sorting_algorithms/selection_sort/images/SelectionSort.gif)
- Summary of how Selection Sort should work:
  1. Set MIN to location 0
  2. Search the minimum element in the list.
  3. Swap with value at location Min
  4. Increment Min to point to next element.
  5. Repeat until list is sorted.

```js
let selectionSort = (arr) => {
  let len = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    let min = i;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
      if (arr[min] > arr[j]) {
        min = j;
      }
    }
    if (min !== i) {
      let tmp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[min];
      arr[min] = tmp;
    }
  }
  return arr;
};
```

# **Sorting Algorithms**

## **Bubble Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- The inner for-loop contributes to O(n), however in a worst case scenario the while loop will need to run n times before bringing all n elements to their final resting spot.

**`Space Complexity`**: O(1)

- Bubble Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

        array[i + 1] = temp;
        sorted = false;
      }
    }
  }
  return array;
}
```

## **Selection Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n^2);

**`Space Complexity`**: O(1)

- Selection Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

      if (array[j] < array[i]) {
        lowest = j;
      }
    }
    if (lowest !== i) {
      let temp = array[i];
      array[i] = array[lowest];
      array[lowest] = temp;
    }
  }
  return array;
}
```

## **Insertion Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n^2);

**`Space Complexity`**: O(n)

- Because we are creating a subArray for each element in the original input, our Space Comlexity becomes linear.

    list[hole] = value;

      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j--;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = current;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

---

## **Merge Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Log Linear O(nlog(n))

- Since our array gets split in half every single time we contribute O(log(n)). The while loop contained in our helper merge function contributes O(n) therefore our time complexity is O(nlog(n));
  **`Space Complexity`**: O(n)
- We are linear O(n) time because we are creating subArrays.

  let result = [];
  while (arr1.length && arr2.length) {
    if (arr1[0] < arr2[0]) {

    } else {
      result.push(arr2.shift());
    }
  }
  return [...result, ...arr1, ...arr2];
}

function mergeSort(arr) {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;

  const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

  return merge(left, right);
}
```

## **Quick Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Even though the average time complexity O(nLog(n)), the worst case scenario is always quadratic.

**`Space Complexity`**: O(n)

- Our space complexity is linear O(n) because of the partition arrays we create.

  let sortedLeft = quickSort(left);
  let sortedRight = quickSort(right);

  return [...sortedLeft, pivot, ...sortedRight];
}
```

## **Binary Search**

**`Time Complexity`**: Log Time O(log(n))

**`Space Complexity`**: O(1)

> Recursive Solution

## **Insertion Sort**

![insert](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/naive_sorting_algorithms/insertion_sort/images/InsertionSort.gif)

- Works by building a larger and larger sorted region at the left-most end of the array.
- Steps:
  1. If it is the first element, and it is already sorted; return 1.
  2. Pick next element.
  3. Compare with all elements in the sorted sub list
  4. Shift all the elemnts in the sorted sub list that is greater than the value to be sorted.
  5. Insert the value
  6. Repeat until list is sorted.

```js
let insertionSort = (inputArr) => {
  let length = inputArr.length;
  for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {
    let key = inputArr[i];
    let j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && inputArr[j] > key) {
      inputArr[j + 1] = inputArr[j];
      j = j - 1;
    }
    inputArr[j + 1] = key;
  }
  return inputArr;
};
```

---

## **Merge Sort**

![merge](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/efficient_sorting_algorithms/merge_sort/images/MergeSort.gif)

- Merge sort is nlogn time.
- We need a function for merging and a function for sorting.
- Steps:
  1. If there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted; return the array.
  2. Otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no longer be divided.
  3. Merge the smallest lists into new list in a sorted order.

```js
const merge = (arr1, arr2) => {
  let sorted = [];

  while (arr1.length && arr2.length) {
    if (arr1[0] < arr2[0]) sorted.push(arr1.shift());
    else sorted.push(arr2.shift());
  }

  return sorted.concat(arr1.slice().concat(arr2.slice()));
};
```

```js
const mergeSort = (arr) => {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2),
    left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid)),
    right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

  return merge(left, right);
};
```

---

## **Quick Sort**

- QS is another Divide and Conquer strategy.
- Some key ideas to keep in mind:
  - It is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value.
  - An array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted.

```js
function quick_Sort(origArray) {
  if (origArray.length <= 1) {
    return origArray;
  } else {
    let left = [];
    let right = [];
    let newArray = [];
    let pivot = origArray.pop();
    let length = origArray.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      if (origArray[i] <= pivot) {
        left.push(origArray[i]);
      } else {
        right.push(origArray[i]);
      }
    }

    return newArray.concat(quick_Sort(left), pivot, quick_Sort(right));
  }
}
```

**binary search**

```js
const binarySearch = (array, target) => {
  let startIndex = 0;
  let endIndex = array.length - 1;
  while(startIndex <= endIndex) {
    let middleIndex = Math.floor((startIndex + endIndex) / 2);
    if(target === array[middleIndex) {
      return console.log("Target was found at index " + middleIndex);
    }
    if(target > array[middleIndex]) {
      console.log("Searching the right side of Array")
      startIndex = middleIndex + 1;
    }
    if(target < array[middleIndex]) {
      console.log("Searching the left side of array")
      endIndex = middleIndex - 1;
    }
    else {
      console.log("Not Found this loop iteration. Looping another iteration.")
    }
  }

  console.log("Target value not found in array");
}
```
# **Notes**

## **Linked Lists**

- A **`linked list`** represents a linear sequence of 'vertices' or 'nodes' and tracks three properties.
  - **`Head`** : The first node in the list.
  - **`Tail`** : The last node in the list.
  - **`Length`** : The number of nodes in the list; the list's length.
- **`Nodes`** : Simpler, smaller data structure that connects the linked list.
- Node Properties:
  - **`Value`** : THe actual value this node represents.
  - **`Next`** : The next node in the list (relative to this node).
  - **`Previous`** : The previous node in the list (relative to this node).

## Introduction

Code reviews can inspire dread in both reviewer and reviewee. Having your
code analyzed can feel as invasive and uncomfortable. Even worse, reviewing other 
people's code can feel like a painful and ambiguous exercise, searching 
for problems and not even knowing where to begin.

This project aims to provide some solid tips for how to review the code that
you and your team write. All examples are written in JavaScript, but the advice
should be applicable to any project of any language. This is by no means an
exhaustive list, but hopefully this will help you catch as many bugs as
possible long before users ever see your feature.

## Why Review Code?

Code reviews are a necessary part of the software engineering process because
you alone can't catch every problem in a piece of code you
write. That's ok though! Even the best basketball players in the world miss
shots.

Having others review our work ensures that we deliver the best product to users
and with the least amount of errors. Make sure your team implements a code
review process for new code that is introduced into your codebase. Find a
process that works for you and your team. There's no one size fits all. The
important point is to do code reviews as regularly as possible.

## Basics

### Code reviews should be as automated as possible

Avoid discussing details that can be handled by a static analysis tool. Don't
argue about nuances such as code formatting and whether to use `let` or `var`.
Having a formatter and linter can save your team a lot of time from reviews
that your computer can do for you.

### Code reviews should avoid API discussion

These discussions should happen before the code is even written. Don't try to
argue about the floor plan once you've poured the concrete
foundation.

### Code reviews should be kind

It's scary to have your code reviewed and it can bring about feelings of
insecurity in even the most experienced developer. Be positive in your language
and keep your teammates comfortable and secure in their work!

## Readability

### Typos should be corrected

Avoid nitpicking as much as you can and save it for your linter, compiler, and
formatter. When you can't, such as in the case of typos, leave a kind comment
suggesting a fix. It's the little things that make a big difference sometimes!

### Variable and function names should be clear

Naming is one of the hardest problems in computer science. We've all given names
to variables, functions, and files that are confusing. Help your teammate out
by suggesting a clearer name, if the one you're reading doesn't make sense.

```javascript
// This function could be better named as namesToUpperCase
function u(names) {
  // ...
}
```

### Functions should be short

Functions should do one thing! Long functions usually mean that they are doing
too much. Tell your teammate to split out the function into multiple different
ones.

```javascript
// This is both emailing clients and deciding which are active. Should be
// 2 different functions.
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

### Files should be cohesive, and ideally short

Just like functions, a file should be about one thing. A file represents a
module and a module should do one thing for your codebase.

For example, if your module is called `fake-name-generator` it should just be
responsible for creating fake names like "Keyser Söze". If the
`fake-name-generator` also includes a bunch of utility functions for querying a
database of names, that should be in a separate module.

There's no rule for how long a file should be, but if it's long like below **and**
includes functions that don't relate to one another, then it should probably
be split apart.

```javascript
// Line 1
import _ from 'lodash';
function generateFakeNames() {
  // ..
}

// Line 1128
function queryRemoteDatabase() {
  // ...
}
```

### Exported functions should be documented

If your function is intended to be used by other libraries, it helps to add
documentation so users of it know what it does.

```javascript
// This needs documentation. What is this function for? How is it used?
export function networkMonitor(graph, duration, failureCallback) {
  // ...
}
```

### Complex code should be commented

If you have named things well and the logic is still confusing, then it's time
for a comment.

```javascript
function leftPad(str, len, ch) {
  str = str + '';
  len = len - str.length;

  while (true) {
    // This needs a comment, why a bitwise and here?
    if (len & 1) pad += ch;
    // This needs a comment, why a bit shift here?
    len >>= 1;
    if (len) ch += ch;
    else break;
  }

  return pad + str;
}
```

## Side Effects

### Functions should be as pure as possible

```javascript
// Global variable is referenced by the following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it
// could break it. Instead it's better to pass in a name parameter
let name = 'Ryan McDermott';

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(' ');
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();
```

### I/O functions should have failure cases handled

Any function that does I/O should handle when something goes wrong

```javascript
function getIngredientsFromFile() {
  const onFulfilled = buffer => {
    let lines = buffer.split('\n');
    return lines.forEach(line => <Ingredient ingredient={line} />);
  };

  // What about when this rejected because of an error? What do we return?
  return readFile('./ingredients.txt').then(onFulfilled);
}
```

## Limits

### Null cases should be handled

If you have a list component for example, all is well and good if you display a
nice beautiful table that shows all its data. Your users love it and you get a
promotion! But what happens when no data comes back? What do you show in the
null case? Your code should be resilient to every case that can occur. If
there's something bad that can happen in your code, eventually it will happen.

```javascript
class InventoryList {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Product</th>
          </tr>
          // We should show something for the null case here if there's // nothing
          in the data inventory
          {Object.keys(this.data.inventory).map(itemId => (
            <tr key={i}>
              <td>{itemId}</td>

              <td>{this.state.inventory[itemId].product}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    );
  }
}
```

### Large cases should be handled

In the list above, what would happen if 10,000 items came back from the
inventory? In that case, you need some form of pagination or infinite scroll.
Be sure to always assess the potential edge cases in terms of volume, especially
when it comes to UI programming.

### Singular cases should be handled

```javascript
class MoneyDislay {
  constructor(amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  render() {
    // What happens if the user has 1 dollar? You can't say plural "dollars"
    return (
      <div className="fancy-class">
        You have {this.amount} dollars in your account
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### User input should be limited

Users can potentially input an unlimited amount of data to send to you. It's
important to set limits if a function takes any kind of user data in.

```javascript
router.route('/message').post((req, res) => {
  const message = req.body.content;

  // What happens if the message is many megabytes of data? Do we want to store
  // that in the database? We should set limits on the size.
  db.save(message);
});
```

### Functions should handle unexpected user input

Users will always surprise you with the data they give you. Don't expect that
you will always get the right type of data or even any data in a request from a
user. [And don't rely on client-side validation alone](https://twitter.com/ryconoclast/status/885523459748487169)

```javascript
router.route('/transfer-money').post((req, res) => {
  const amount = req.body.amount;
  const from = user.id;
  const to = req.body.to;

  // What happens if we got a string instead of a number as our amount? This
  // function would fail
  transferMoney(from, to, amount);
});
```

## Security

Data security is the most important aspect of your application. If users can't
trust you with their data, then you won't have a business. There are numerous
different types of security exploits that can plague an app, depending on the
particular language and runtime environment. Below is a very small and
incomplete list of common security problems. Don't rely on this alone! Automate
as much security review as you can on every commit, and perform routine security
audits.

### XSS should not be possible

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the largest vectors for security attacks
on a web application. It occurs when you take user data and include it in your
page without first properly sanitizing it. This can cause your site to execute
source code from remote pages.

```javascript
function getBadges() {
  let badge = document.getElementsByClassName('badge');
  let nameQueryParam = getQueryParams('name');

  /**
   * What if nameQueryParam was `<script>sendCookie(document.cookie)</script>`?
   * If that was the query param, a malicious user could lure a user to click a
   * link with that as the `name` query param, and have the user unknowingly
   * send their data to a bad actor.
   */
  badge.children[0].innerHTML = nameQueryParam;
}
```

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should not leak

You bear an enormous weight of responsibility every time you take in user data.
If you leak data in URLs, in analytics tracking to third parties, or even expose
data to employees that shouldn't have access, you greatly hurt your users and
your business. Be careful with other people's lives!

```javascript
router.route('/bank-user-info').get((req, res) => {
  const name = user.name;
  const id = user.id;
  const socialSecurityNumber = user.ssn;

  // There's no reason to send a socialSecurityNumber back in a query parameter
  // This would be exposed in the URL and potentially to any middleman on the
  // network watching internet traffic
  res.addToQueryParams({
    name,
    id,
    socialSecurityNumber
  });
});
```

## Performance

### Functions should use efficient algorithms and data structures

This is different for every particular case, but use your best judgment to see
if there are any ways to improve the efficiency of a piece of code. Your users
will thank you for the faster speeds!

```javascript
// If mentions was a hash data structure, you wouldn't need to iterate through
// all mentions to find a user. You could simply return the presence of the
// user key in the mentions hash
function isUserMentionedInComments(mentions, user) {
  let mentioned = false;
  mentions.forEach(mention => {
    if (mention.user === user) {
      mentioned = true;
    }
  });

  return mentioned;
}
```

### Important actions should be logged

Logging helps give metrics about performance and insight into user behavior.
Not every action needs to be logged, but decide with your team what makes sense
to keep track of for data analytics. And be sure that no personally identifiable
information is exposed!

```javascript
router.route('/request-ride').post((req, res) => {
  const currentLocation = req.body.currentLocation;
  const destination = req.body.destination;

  requestRide(user, currentLocation, destination).then(result => {
    // We should log before and after this block to get a metric for how long
    // this task took, and potentially even what locations were involved in ride
    // ...
  });
});
```

## Testing

### New code should be tested

All new code should include a test, whether it fixes a bug, or is a new feature.
If it's a bug fix, it should have a test proving that the bug is fixed. And if
it's a new feature, then every component should be unit tested and there should
be an integration test ensuring that the feature works with the rest of the
system.

### Tests should actually test all of what the function does

```javascript
function payEmployeeSalary(employeeId, amount, callback) {
  db.get('EMPLOYEES', employeeId)
    .then(user => {
      return sendMoney(user, amount);
    })
    .then(res => {
      if (callback) {
        callback(res);
      }

      return res;
    });
}

const callback = res => console.log('called', res);
const employee = createFakeEmployee('john jacob jingleheimer schmidt');
const result = payEmployeeSalary(employee.id, 1000, callback);
assert(result.status === enums.SUCCESS);
// What about the callback? That should be tested
```

### Tests should stress edge cases and limits of a function

```javascript
function dateAddDays(dateTime, day) {
  // ...
}

let dateTime = '1/1/2017';
let date1 = dateAddDays(dateTime, 5);

assert(date1 === '1/6/2017');

// What happens if we add negative days?
// What happens if we add fractional days: 1.2, 8.7, etc.
// What happens if we add 1 billion days?
```

## Miscellaneous

> _"Everything can be filed under miscellaneous"_

> George Bernard Shaw

### TODO comments should be tracked

TODO comments are great for letting you and your fellow engineers know that something
needs to be fixed later. Sometimes you gotta ship code and wait to fix it
later. But eventually you'll have to clean it up! That's why you should track it
and give a corresponding ID from your issue tracking system so you can schedule
it and keep track of where the problem is in your codebase.

### Commit messages should be clear and accurately describe new code

We've all written commit messages like "Changed some crap", "damn it",
"ugg one more to fix this stupid bug". These are funny and satisfying, but not
helpful when you're up on a Saturday morning because you pushed code on a Friday
night and can't figure out what the bad code was doing when you `git blamed` the
commit. Write commit messages that describe the code accurately, and include
a ticket number from your issue tracking system if you have one. That will make
searching through your commit log much easier.

### The code should do what it's supposed to do

This seems obvious, but most reviewers don't have the time or take the time to
manually test every user-facing change. It's important to make sure the business
logic of every change is as per design. It's easy to forget that when you're
just looking for problems in the code!

# Data structures in JavaScript


>space
The space complexity represents the memory consumption of a data structure. As for most of the things in life, you can't have it all, so it is with the data structures. You will generally need to trade some time for space or the other way around.

>time
The time complexity for a data structure is in general more diverse than its space complexity.

>Several operations
In contrary to algorithms, when you look at the time complexity for data structures you need to express it for several operations that you can do with data structures. It can be adding elements, deleting elements, accessing an element or even searching for an element.

>Dependent on data
Something that data structure and algorithms have in common when talking about time complexity is that they are both dealing with data. When you deal with data you become dependent on them and as a result the time complexity is also dependent of the data that you received. To solve this problem we talk about 3 different time complexity.

- [ ] **The best-case complexity: when the data looks the best**
- [ ] **The worst-case complexity: when the data looks the worst**
- [ ] **The average-case complexity: when the data looks average**


## Big O notation
The complexity is usually expressed with the Big O notation. The wikipedia page about this subject is pretty complex but you can find here a good summary of the different complexity for the most famous data structures and sorting algorithms.

## The Array data structure
Definition
An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array. From Wikipedia

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures.

## TheHash Table data structure
>Definition
A Hash Table (Hash Map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A Hash Table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. From Wikipedia

Hash Tables are considered the more efficient data structure for lookup and for this reason, they are widely used.

>The code

Because my calculateHash function is overly simple (mod of the key length) I need to be sure that I am able to save more than one value for every hash. As a consequence I am storing another object for every hash in my Hash Table.

A better example would have had a calculateHash function that returns only one possible hash for every key. I could have done that with a simple JavaScript Object (the hash being the same as the key) but the specificity of the Hash Table data structure is to have this special calculateHash function.



```js

  class HashTable {
    constructor( size ) {
        this.values = {};
        this.numberOfValues = 0;
        this.size = size;
    }
    add( key, value ) {
        let hash = this.calculateHash( key );
        if ( !this.values.hasOwnProperty( hash ) ) {
            this.values[ hash ] = {};
        }
        if ( !this.values[ hash ].hasOwnProperty( key ) ) {
            this.numberOfValues++;
        }
        this.values[ hash ][ key ] = value;
    }
    remove( key ) {
        let hash = this.calculateHash( key );
        if (
            this.values.hasOwnProperty( hash ) &&
            this.values[ hash ].hasOwnProperty( key )
        ) {
            delete this.values[ hash ][ key ];
            this.numberOfValues--;
        }
    }
    calculateHash( key ) {
        return key.toString().length % this.size;
    }
    search( key ) {
        let hash = this.calculateHash( key );
        if (
            this.values.hasOwnProperty( hash ) &&
            this.values[ hash ].hasOwnProperty( key )
        ) {
            return this.values[ hash ][ key ];
        } else {
            return null;
        }
    }
    length() {
        return this.numberOfValues;
    }
    print() {
        let string = "";
        for ( let value in this.values ) {
            for ( let key in this.values[ value ] ) {
                string += this.values[ value ][ key ] + " ";
            }
        }
        console.log( string.trim() );
    }

hashTable.add( "second", 2 );
hashTable.add( "third", 3 );

hashTable.add( "fifth", 5 );
hashTable.print(); // => 2 4 1 3 5
console.log( "length gives 5:", hashTable.length() ); // => 5
console.log( "search second gives 2:", hashTable.search( "second" ) ); // => 2
hashTable.remove( "fourth" );

## The Set

>Definition
A Set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite Set. From Wikipedia

The Set data structure is usually used to test whether elements belong to set of values. Rather then only containing elements, Sets are more used to perform operations on multiple values at once with methods such as union, intersect, etc…

## The Singly Linked List 

>Definition
A Singly Linked List is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes pointing to the next node by means of pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. From Wikipedia

Linked Lists are among the simplest and most common data structures because it allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.

A Doubly Linked List is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes. From Wikipedia

Having two node links allow traversal in either direction but adding or removing a node in a doubly linked list requires changing more links than the same operations on a Singly Linked List.

## The Stack 


>Definition
A Stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. The order in which elements come off a Stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (for last in, first out). From Wikipedia

A Stack often has a third method peek which allows to check the last pushed element without popping it.

## The Queue


>Definition
A Queue is a particular kind of abstract data type or collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal operations are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue. This makes the Queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the Queue will be the first one to be removed. From Wikipedia

As for the Stack data structure, a peek operation is often added to the Queue data structure. It returns the value of the front element without dequeuing it.

## The Tree


>Definition
A Tree is a widely used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node. A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root node.

## The Graph


>Definition
A Graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected Graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed Graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, or lines for an undirected Graph and as arrows, directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines for a directed Graph. The vertices may be part of the Graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references. From Wikipedia

A Graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).

Representation
There are different ways of representing a graph, each of them with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are the main 2:

Adjacency list: For every vertex a list of adjacent vertices is stored. This can be viewed as storing the list of edges. This data structure allows the storage of additional data on the vertices and edges.
Adjacency matrix: Data are stored in a two-dimensional matrix, in which the rows represent source vertices and columns represent destination vertices. The data on the edges and vertices must be stored externally.
Complexity
Adjacency list         
Storage  Add Vertex  Add Edge  Query
O(  V  +  E
Adjacency matrix         
Storage  Add Vertex  Add Edge  Query
O(  V  ^2)  O(

### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/Deploy-React-App-2-Heroku.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/Deploy-React-App-2-Heroku.md)



Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

Before you begin deploying, **make sure to remove any `console.log`'s or `debugger`'s in any production code**. You can search your entire project folder if you are using them anywhere.

You will set up Heroku to run on a production, not development, version of your application. When a Node.js application like yours is pushed up to Heroku, it is identified as a Node.js application because of the `package.json` file. It runs `npm install` automatically. Then, if there is a `heroku-postbuild` script in the `package.json` file, it will run that script. Afterwards, it will automatically run `npm start`.

In the following phases, you will configure your application to work in production, not just in development, and configure the `package.json` scripts for `install`, `heroku-postbuild` and `start` scripts to install, build your React application, and start the Express production server.

Phase 1: Heroku Connection
--------------------------

If you haven't created a Heroku account yet, create one [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

Add a new application in your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) named whatever you want. Under the "Resources" tab in your new application, click "Find more add-ons" and add the "Heroku Postgres" add-on with the free Hobby Dev setting.

In your terminal, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line). Afterwards, login to Heroku in your terminal by running the following:

    heroku login

Add Heroku as a remote to your project's git repository in the following command and replace `<name-of-Heroku-app>` with the name of the application you created in the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

    heroku git:remote -a <name-of-Heroku-app>

Next, you will set up your Express + React application to be deployable to Heroku.

Phase 2: Setting up your Express + React application
----------------------------------------------------

Right now, your React application is on a different localhost port than your Express application. However, since your React application only consists of static files that don't need to bundled continuously with changes in production, your Express application can serve the React assets in production too. These static files live in the `frontend/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder.

Add the following changes into your `backend/routes.index.js` file.

At the root route, serve the React application's static `index.html` file along with `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. Then serve up all the React application's static files using the `express.static` middleware. Serve the `index.html` and set the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie again on all routes that don't start in `/api`. You should already have this set up in `backend/routes/index.js` which should now look like this:

    // backend/routes/index.js
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();
    const apiRouter = require('./api');
    
    router.use('/api', apiRouter);
    
    // Static routes
    // Serve React build files in production
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      const path = require('path');
      // Serve the frontend's index.html file at the root route
      router.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.sendFile(
          path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
        );
      });
    
      // Serve the static assets in the frontend's build folder
      router.use(express.static(path.resolve("../frontend/build")));
    
      // Serve the frontend's index.html file at all other routes NOT starting with /api
      router.get(/^(?!\/?api).*/, (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.sendFile(
          path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
        );
      });
    }
    
    // Add a XSRF-TOKEN cookie in development
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      router.get('/api/csrf/restore', (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.status(201).json({});
      });
    }
    
    module.exports = router;

Your Express backend's `package.json` should include scripts to run the `sequelize` CLI commands.

The `backend/package.json`'s scripts should now look like this:

      "scripts": {
        "sequelize": "sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "sequelize-cli",
        "start": "per-env",
        "start:development": "nodemon -r dotenv/config ./bin/www",
        "start:production": "node ./bin/www"
      },

Initialize a `package.json` file at the very root of your project directory (outside of both the `backend` and `frontend` folders). The scripts defined in this `package.json` file will be run by Heroku, not the scripts defined in the `backend/package.json` or the `frontend/package.json`.

When Heroku runs `npm install`, it should install packages for both the `backend` and the `frontend`. Overwrite the `install` script in the root `package.json` with:

    npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend

This will run `npm install` in the `backend` folder then run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.

Next, define a `heroku-postbuild` script that will run the `npm run build` command in the `frontend` folder. Remember, Heroku will automatically run this script after running `npm install`.

Define a `sequelize` script that will run `npm run sequelize` in the `backend` folder.

Finally, define a `start` that will run `npm start` in the \`backend folder.

The root `package.json`'s scripts should look like this:

      "scripts": {
        "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build --prefix frontend",
        "install": "npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend",
        "dev:backend": "npm install --prefix backend start",
        "dev:frontend": "npm install --prefix frontend start",
        "sequelize": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize-cli",
        "start": "npm start --prefix backend"
      },

The `dev:backend` and `dev:frontend` scripts are optional and will not be used for Heroku.

Finally, commit your changes.

Phase 3: Deploy to Heroku
-------------------------

Once you're finished setting this up, navigate to your application's Heroku dashboard. Under "Settings" there is a section for "Config Vars". Click the `Reveal Config Vars` button to see all your production environment variables. You should have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable already from the Heroku Postgres add-on.

Add environment variables for `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and `JWT_SECRET` and any other environment variables you need for production.

You can also set environment variables through the Heroku CLI you installed earlier in your terminal. See the docs for [Setting Heroku Config Variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

Push your project to Heroku. Heroku only allows the `master` branch to be pushed. But, you can alias your branch to be named `master` when pushing to Heroku. For example, to push a branch called `login-branch` to `master` run:

    git push heroku login-branch:master

If you do want to push the `master` branch, just run:

    git push heroku master

You may want to make two applications on Heroku, the `master` branch site that should have working code only. And your `staging` site that you can use to test your work in progress code.

Now you need to migrate and seed your production database.

Using the Heroku CLI, you can run commands inside of your production application just like in development using the `heroku run` command.

For example to migrate the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:migrate

To seed the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:seed:all

Note: You can interact with your database this way as you'd like, but beware that `db:drop` **cannot** be run in the Heroku environment. If you want to drop and create the database, you need to remove and add back the "Heroku Postgres" add-on.

Another way to interact with the production application is by opening a bash shell through your terminal by running:

    heroku bash

In the opened shell, you can run things like `npm run sequelize db:migrate`.

Open your deployed site and check to see if you successfully deployed your Express + React application to Heroku!

If you see an `Application Error` or are experiencing different behavior than what you see in your local environment, check the logs by running:

    heroku logs

If you want to open a connection to the logs to continuously output to your terminal, then run:

    heroku logs --tail

The logs may clue you into why you are experiencing errors or different behavior.

### Wrapping up

You can also open your site in the browser with `heroku open`. If it works, congratulations, you've created a production-ready, dynamic, full-stack website that can be securely accessed anywhere in the world! Give yourself a pat on the back. You're a web developer!



### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/DOM-VS-BOM.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/DOM-VS-BOM.md)

## DOM vs BOM
    - the `Document Object Model` is the hierarchy/representation of the objects that comprise a document on the web (i.e. how all elements in a document are organized). The DOM is a part of the `Browser Object Model`, the hierarchy/representation of all browser objects associated with the web browser. 

**Browser Diagram**
                            User Interface
                                   v
                            Browser Engine   --->   Data Persistence
                                   v
                            Rendering Engine
                        v          v          v
                Networking  JS interpreter  UI backend
                ======================================
    - `User Interface`: everything in browser interface except requested page content
    - `Browser Engine`: manages interactions btwen UI and rendering engine
    - `Rendering Engine`: renders requested page content, parsing HTML & CSS
    - `Networking`: handles network calls, i.e. HTTP requests
    - `JS Interpreter`: parses & executes JS code
    - `UI Backend`: used for drawing basic widgets, using operating system UI methods
    - `Data Persistence`: persistence of data stored in browser, i.e. cookies

    - A browser's main role in the request/response cycle is:
        1. Parsing HTML, CSS, JS
        2. Rendering that information to the user by constructing a DOM tree and rendering it. 

**Request-Response Diagram**

    Click --->          Request --->        Server <----> Data
        Browser
    Page <---           <--- Response      

    Your Computer       The Internet        Data Center

**Window API**
-   the `Window API` includes the methods and properties that you can use on the `window object`, the core of the `BOM`. 
-   using the `Window API` to resize the browser window:
    
    ```js
    //opens a new window
    newWindow = window.open("url", "name", "width=100, height=100")
    //resizes new window
    newWindow.resizeTo(500,500)
    //also resizes by given amount; use `-` to shrink
    newWindow.resizeBy(xDelta, yDelta)
    ```

-   the `context` of an `anonymous function` fun in the browser will be the `window object`. Remember that every function has a context, which we can think of as which object OWNS the function, and context is most often determined by how a function is invoked. 

**Running Scripts**
- Insert a script via a .js document into an .html document:
    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="dom-ready-script.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body><form>
 <input type="button" value="Go back!" onclick="history.back()">
</form>
  </body>
    <html></html>
    </html>
    ```
- Run the script on DOMContentLoaded (when the doc has been loaded, but without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes):
    ```js
    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
        console.log("This script loaded when the DOM was ready.");
    });
    ```
- Run the script on page load using window.onload (wait for EVERYTHING to load):
    ```js
    window.onload = () => {
        console.log(
            "This script loaded when all the resources and the DOM were ready."
        );
    };
    ```
- Three ways to prevent script from running until page loads:
    1. Use `DOMContentLoaded`
    2. Place `script tag` at very bottom of HTML file
    3. Add attribute like `async` or `defer`

**async vs defer**
    - `<script>` without any attributes will pause HTML parsing, and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it is external). The script will be executed before parsing is resumed. 
    - `async` downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it once it has downloaded. 
    - `defer` downloads the file during HTML parsing, but will only execute it after the parser has completed. 
    - the standard is to use `async`, then `defer`. 

**Cookies vs Web Storage API**
- Cookies - stores stateful info about a user, transfers data to server, under 4KB storage limit
- `sessionStorage` - stores data only for a session, until browser window/tab is closed, does not transfer data to server, 5MB storage limit.
- `localStorage` - stores data w/no expiration date, does not transfer data to server, deleted when browser cache is cleared; maximum storage limit

- Create a cookie:
    ```js
    const firstCookie = "favoriteCat=million";
    document.cookie = firstCookie;
    const secondCookie = "favoriteDog=bambi";
    document.cookie = secondCookie;
    document.cookie; // Returns "favoriteCat=million; favoriteDog=bambi"
    ```
- Delete a cookie by setting a cookie's expiration date to the past (or delete in Developer Tools):
    ```js
    document.cookie = "favoriteCat=; expires = Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";
      document.cookie; // Returns "favoriteDog=bambi"
    ```
- Create localStorage data:
    ```js
    //set new localStorage item
    localStorage.setItem("firstThing", "firstValue");
    //retrieve that localStorage item
    localSTorage.getItem("firstThing");
    ```

- When to use the Web Storage API?
    - shopping cart
    - input data on forms
    - info on user i.e. preferences or buying habits
- When to use cookies:
    - Session cookie, stores session info on user login/validation (lost once browser is closed unless you use a persistent cookie)

- You can view cookies and web storage info with Developer Tools (inspect -> Application tab).

12. ✓ Write JS to store the value "I <3 falafel" with the eky "eatz" in the browser's local storage.
13. ✓ Write JS to read the value stored in local storage for the key "paper-trail". 

*ELEMENT SELECTION*
1. Given HTML that includes `<div id="catch-me-if-you-can>HI!</div>`, write a JS statement that stores a reference to the HTMLDivElement with the id "catch-me-if-you-can" in a variable named "divOfInterest".

    ```js
    let divOfInterest = document.getElementById("catch-me-if-you-can");
    ```

2. Given HTML that includes seven SPAN elements each with the class "cloudy", write a JS statement that stores a reference to a NodeList filled with references to the seven HTMLSpanElements in a variable named "cloud

    ```js
    let cloudyNodes = document.querySelectorAll("span.cloudy");
    ```

3. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, and BODY elements, create and reference a JS file that in which the JS will create and attach to the BODY element an H1 element with the id "sleeping-giant" with the content "Jell-O, Burled!".

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="location.file"></script>
    ```
    ```js
    let newHeader = document.createElement("h1");
    newHeader.setAttribute("id", "sleeping-giant");
    newHeader.innerHTML = "Jell-O, Burled!";
    //const newContent = document.createTextNode("Jell-O, Burled!");
    document.body.appendChild(newHeader);
    ```

4. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with the SCRIPT's SRC attribute referencing an empty JS file, write a script in the JS file to create a DIV element with the id "lickable-frog" and add it as the last child to the BODY element.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="location.file"></script>
    ```
    ```js
    let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
    newDiv.setAttribute("id", "lickable-frog");
    document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
    ```


5. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with no SRC attribute on the SCRIPT element, write a script in the SCRIPT block to create a UL element with no id, create an LI element with the id "dreamy-eyes, add the LI as a child to the UL element, and add the UL element as the first child of the BODY element. 

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
        let newList = document.createElement("ul");
        let newItem = document.createElement("li");
        newItem.setAttribute("id", "dreamy-eyes");
        newList.appendChild(newItem);
        document.body.prepend(newList);
    </script>
    ```

6. Write JS to add the CSS class "i-got-loaded" to the BODY element when the window fires the DOMContentLoaded event. 

    ```js
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
       document.body.className("i-got-loaded");
    });
    ```

7. Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-best-friend" that has six non-empty ILs as its children, write JS to write the content of each LI to the console. 

    ```js
    let parentList = document.getElementById("your-best-friend");
    let childNodes = parent.childNodes;
    for (let value of childNodes.values()) {
        console.log(value);
    }
    ```

8. Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-worst-enemy" that has no children, write JS to construct a string that contains six LI tags each containing a random number and set the inner HTML property of ul#your-worst-enemy to that string. 

    ```js
    const getRandomInt = max => {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
    }
    const liArr = [];
    for (let i = 0, i < 6, i++) {
        liArr.push("<li>" + getRandomInt(10) + "</li>")
    }
    const liString = liArr.join(" ");
    const listElement = document.getElementById("your-worst-enemy")
    listElement.innerHTML = liString;
    ```

9. Write JS to update the title of the document to the current time at a reasonable interval such that it looks like a real clock. 
    ```html
    <title id="title"></title>
    ```
    ```js
    const title = document.getElementById("title");
    const time = () => {
        const date = new Date();
        const seconds = date.getSeconds();
        const minutes = date.getMinutes();
        const hours = date.getHours();

        title.innerHTML = `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`
    };
    setInterval(time, 1000);
    ```

*EVENT HANDLING*
1. Given an HTML page that includes `<button id="increment-count">I have been clicked <span id="clicked-count">0</span> times</button>`, write JS that increases the value of the content of `span#clicked-count` by 1 every time `button#increment-count` is clicked. 

    ```js
    let incrementButton = document.getElementById("increment-count");
    let incrementSpan = document.getElementById("clicked-count");
    let count = 0
    incrementButton.addEventListener("click", event => {
        count++
        incrementSpan.innerHTML = count
    });
    ```
2. Given an HTML page that includes `<input type="checkbox" id="on-off"><div id="now-you-see-me">Now you see me</div>`, write JS that sets the display of div#now-you-see-me to "none" when input#on-off is checked and "block" when input#on-off is not checked. 

    ```js
    let inputBox = document.getElementById("checkbox");
    let divSee = document.getElementById("now-you-see-me");
    inputBox.addEventListener("click", event => {
        if (inputBox.checked) {
            divSee.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            divSee.style.display = "none";
        };
    });
    ```

3. Given an HTML file that includes `<input id="stopper" type="text" placeholder="Quick! Type STOP">`, write JS that will change the background color of the page to cyan five seconds after a page loads unless the field input#stopper contains only the text "STOP". 

    ```js
    let inputStopper = document.getElementById("stopper");
    const stopCyanMadness = () => {
        if (inputStopper.value !== "STOP") {
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = "cyan";
        }
    };
    setTimeout(stopCyanMadness, 5000);
    ```
4. Given an HTML page that includes `<input type="text" id="fancypants">`, write JS that changes the background color of the textbox to #E8F5E9 when the caret is in the textbox and turns it back to its normal color when focus is elsewhere. 

    ```js
    const input = document.getElementById("fancypands");
    input.addEventListener("focus", event => {
        event.target.style.backgroundColor = "#E8F5E9";
    });
    input.addEventListener("blur", event => {
        event.target.style.backgroundColor = "initial";
    })
    ```

5. Given an HTML page that includes a form with two password fields, write JS that subscribes to the forms submission event and cancels it if the values in the two password fields differ. 

    ```js
    let form = document.getElementById("signup-form");
    let passwordOne = document.getElementById("password);
    let passwordTwo = document.getElementById("password);
    form.addEventListener("submit", event => {
        if (passwordOne.value !== passwordTwo.value) {
            event.preventDefault();
            alert("Passwords must match!");
        } else {
            alert("The form was submitted!");
        }
    })
    ```

6. Given an HTML page that includes a div styled as a square with a red background, write JS that allows a user to draf the square around the screen. 

    1. Mark the element as draggable:
        ```html
        <div id="red-square" draggable="true"></div>
        ```

7. Given HTML page that has 300 DIVs, create one click event subscription that will print the id of the element clicked on to the console.

    ```js
    document.body.addEventListener("click", event => {
        console.log(event.target.id);
    })
    ```

8. Identify the definition of the bubbling principle. 

    When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

*JSON*
1. Identify and generate valid JSON-formatted strings.

    String in JS:   `'this is "text"'`
    String in JSON: `"this is \"text\""`

    - use \n for line breaks
    - keys in JSON objects must be surrounded by \" quotes


2. Use `JSON.parse` to deserialize JSON-formatted strings.

    ```js
    const str = '[1,"hello, \\"world\\"",3.14,{"id":17}]';
    console.log(JSON.parse(str));
        // prints an array with the following entries:
        //   0: 1
        //   1: "hello, \"world\""
        //   2: 3.14
        //   3: { id: 17 }
    ```

3. Use `JSON.stringify` to serialize JS objects. 

    ```js
    const array = [1, 'hello, "world"', 3.14, { id: 17 }];
    console.log(JSON.stringify(array));
        // prints [1, "hello, \"world\"", 3.14, {"id":17}]
    ```

4. Correctly identify the definition of "serialize". 

    Converting your data into a format that can be sent to another computer. 

5. Correctly idenfity the definition of "deserialize". 

    Getting a message from another computer and converting that message into usable data.

# 9 fancy title design in CSS you need to learn now

> Learn how to EASILY create fancy looking title with only CSS

**Style 1: Line text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qh8otFfZQQ60V2LepbfP8A.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4416/1*qh8otFfZQQ60V2LepbfP8A.png)

The first style we would create is an outlined text, with a 3d text shape behind it. In order to create an "outline" for text, we would need to use the CSS property: `-webkit-text-stroke-width` and `-webkit-text-stroke-color` . These two property allow us to create an outline and give it the desired color.

For the 3d text shape, we could use multiple layer of `text-shadow` property. Since text-shadow can be stacked, in this example, we could add many layers of pink shadow, where each layer offsetting the previous one for 1px in x and y direction. Giving the whole text-shadow a "3D" shape.

Let jump into the code.

HTML (as promise, one div):

<div class='line-text'>foreign terrace</div>

SCSS:

> I create some global variable to store the color and the size, $extra-large is 110px. For the color, check my codepen

This is a fairly easy style, we don't even need to use a before or after pseudo-element. This is a good place to start as it teaches us two very important property in styling text, `text-stroke-width` and `text-shadow`. Say you want a more "3d-looking" text, you could easily add more layer of shadow to it, like so:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2996/1*19aEylsHnaRZBCrndxW4eA.png)

Applying 20px of box shadow

**Style 2: Neon text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2-6Srs31u8h6ZEBQ8VWr6A.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/5368/1*2-6Srs31u8h6ZEBQ8VWr6A.png)

The next style we will create is neon. The text mimic a neon sign by creating lighting effect, also using a more "written" font style.

The first thing to do is to pick a suitable font for the neon text. I picked "Pacifico" (free font on google font) as it has a nice rounded border, and continuous stroke style. Pretty much like the sign made from a neon tube.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*sSysOkBk0DJJvdNSZcgxqQ.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1744/1*sSysOkBk0DJJvdNSZcgxqQ.png)

I believe you have guessed, we would apply `-webkit-text-stroke-width` and `-webkit-text-stroke-color` again as our base for the "neon", `text-shadow` would be used again for the "glowing" light around the neon. If you look carefully, there are one more set of "outlined-text", in black color behind the neon. That is the drop shadow of the neon-tube. And we would use a :after pseudo-element to create it.

HTML:

<div class='neon-text'>underlying wire</div>

SCSS:

> one thing annoying is we need to set content of the pseudo-element manually. I tried to use `content: inherit` but it seems only possible when you set the content in your parent. As I want the HTML to have the text (for demo purpose), it is not really helpful for me.

I am not doing animation this time, but if you want, you could probably do some cool trick like turning the light on and off, changing it color gradiently and so on.

**Style 3: Stripe text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*knpwC9n4XLr-z9GG0K73Rw.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4160/1*knpwC9n4XLr-z9GG0K73Rw.png)

This style has a lot of thing in common with the first style. Firstly, it also has a white border. And secondly, it has a 3d shaped text shadow. We already know how to use `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` and`text-shadow` to create such pattern. One thing different is the colorful stripe pattern of the text.

There are no "linear-gradient" available for text (as of June 2020, let me know if it is a thing now!), so we would need a workaround. Instead of making the text itself having color, we will first create a background, and then use the `background-clip: text` property. This property will "clip" the div by the shape of your text, with a combination of making your text-color transparent, you will end up with text colored with whatever background you are using.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*UnQUNxtvHOel4W4hTz8n9w.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2060/1*UnQUNxtvHOel4W4hTz8n9w.png)

Same thing could be apply to image background, so you could basically give your text whatever texture

We would also use another font family to complement the overall style. The one I picked is "Catamaran" (also free on google font).

HTML:

<div class='stripe-text'>quick turnover</div>

SCSS:

> You may notice I put the background and `background-clip: text` in the :after element, instead of the parent. The reason for that is **"background-clip" clip EVERYTHING inside the element**, include :before and :after element. So applying it there **would cause the 3d shadow being clipped as well**. In fact, the HTML don't need to have the text at all. I am just adding it there for better sizing (as both after and before element are absolute positioned to parent) and demo purpose.

**Style 4: Cut text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*byXm5gNu5VXKWdZ9sjZE_Q.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/3216/1*byXm5gNu5VXKWdZ9sjZE_Q.png)

In all of the style, this one is actually my favourite. It is very different from the other style and our old friend `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` and`text-shadow` won't be helping us this time (sorry about that).

In this style, we have a "cut" in the text, making the upper part of text sliding down in the cut angle. The whole design is also very clean and sharp.

The concept for creating this style is very simply, we make two pseudo element (before and after), and give them two `clip-path`, where the two clip path together form a complete rectangle:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*PA8pm52sLxNIeKyEI9zWuA.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2840/1*PA8pm52sLxNIeKyEI9zWuA.png)

And then we just add a little bit offset for the upper part element to the right and downward, making the text slide down in the "cut" direction.

HTML:

<div class='cut-text'>stolen hour</div>

SCSS:

> For the same reason mentioned in last style, we cannot clip path on the parent directly. and you may also notice in the clip-path, I used 110% instead of 100%. The reason being that the text getting clipped at the very end due to using "italic" style. it is solved by changing the clip border from 100% to a higher number.

**Style 5: Cyber text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YObcSEoVzWZ_KaHG4_S3lg.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4148/1*YObcSEoVzWZ_KaHG4_S3lg.png)

Despite the fancy name, this style is the easiest. We will be using :before and :after pseudo-element, and transparent text-color overlaying on top of each other to create this "funky" effect. The text look kind of blur but actually it is completely straight if you look closely, it is the mixture of the color and minor offset giving it such behavior.

HTML:

<div class='cyber-text'>digital highway</div>

SCSS:

> The SCSS function rgba() allow us to quickly get a less opaque version of your base color, and make experimenting of different color combination easy. (There are also darken()/lighten()/adjust-hue() and soooo much more)

**Style 6: Wood-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lDBHarduK4EUC41wHNdcvQ.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/3900/1*lDBHarduK4EUC41wHNdcvQ.png)

This one is basically the same as the "stripe-text" style, as we are again using `background-clip: text` property. As mentioned, with background-clip property you could easily create any pattern and texture of text, given that you have a background image.

One little twist of this style is the inner "shadow" of the text. It is in fact created with an after element with (again) `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` property.

HTML:

<div class='wood-text'>suitable villa</div>

SCSS:

> Looking back to it now, this one is my least favourite one. Mainly due to the background image I picked doesn't really resemble wood. (in fact the highlight and shading of it make it looks more like metallic) For this type of text style, background image is the soul of it, and could ruin it pretty easily. Don't make the same mistake I did and take your time to pick the perfect picture.

**Style 7: Comic-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-PluYzXMrwt09anUuBne6Q.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/3824/1*-PluYzXMrwt09anUuBne6Q.png)

This comic looking style text resemble old fashion comic text. Everything is heavily outlined, and the stroke are overly decorated. To start with, we will first need a font for this style. I picked "Molle", again (guess you figure out the pattern by now) a free google font.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Q2vMDKRQTPIXfs1EKcTGAQ.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1832/1*Q2vMDKRQTPIXfs1EKcTGAQ.png)

For the style itself, we will use our old friend `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` property (welcome back!).We would use all of our available HTML element for the style, the parent div, before, and after pseudo element.

HTML:

<div class='comic-text'>square tube!</div>

SCSS:

> I am limiting myself to do it in one div only, but you can definitely adding more layer if you want to, just stack the element on top of eachother

**Style 8: horizontal-cut-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*_ZOGCf8dCQAFXHk7pMM42A.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4712/1*_ZOGCf8dCQAFXHk7pMM42A.png)

This style also has the word cut in it, but we won't actually cut it. Instead, we will use a background gradient and `background-clip: text` property again. We will stack two background, one with color at the top 50%, transparent at the bottom 50%, and another background a white and transparent stripe.

On top of the text, we would also add a text-shadow, to give more shape to it. Using a shadow on top of the text with dark background, resulting it having a fake "highlight", which is the original color of the text.

HTML:

<div class='horizontal-cut-text'>vague minority</div>

SCSS:

> Again, another one without any after and before element. In case you don't know already, you can stack background color as much as you want to. Using background property alone could already give us a lot of stunning pattern. If you are interested and want to learn more, you can check out this CSS3 Pattern Gallery: [https://leaverou.github.io/css3patterns/](https://leaverou.github.io/css3patterns/)

**Style 9: Double-border-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bnZB7hU-3oN6O6R2vnTlgw.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4540/1*bnZB7hU-3oN6O6R2vnTlgw.png)

The final style, you guessed it, is a combination of `-webkit-text-stroke-width` and pseudo-element. This is basically the same as the comic style, just with a different font, more consistent and aligned text and color theme.

Since it is very similar, I will jump into the code right now.

HTML:

<div class='double-border-text'>entire volume</div>

SCSS:

> One side note regarding `text-stroke-width`, it seems all powerful but has it own limitation. If the font you are using don't have a beautiful and continuous stroke, your will get a "broken" stroke from the property. Also, be aware that if you set the stroke width too high, there may be unexpected "edge" from the stroke of the text, like below:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/52/1*8D039RUBG9sKBsWt7wA6tw.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/724/1*8D039RUBG9sKBsWt7wA6tw.png)

the edge is coming from the middle stroke of the "E"

Advanced Formatting in GitHub Markdown
======================================

GitHub Flavored Markdown lets you create useful documents in [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/home) using `.md` files.
Like other varieties of markdown, GitHub Markdown tries to be as readable as possible in its raw form, resulting in an intentionally limited set of formatting options.
However, these options can feel restrictive when dealing with complex content.

Although GitHub Markdown strips out most HTML tags, here are a few tricks that can give you more flexibility when formatting your documents.
These advanced formatting options can make your documents more useable, but they come at the expense of plain text readability, so use with caution.

Check out this excellent [cheatsheet](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for an overview of standard formatting in GitHub Markdown.

## Ways to Reference Graph Nodes

---

### Node Class

---

Uses a class to define the neighbors as properties of each node.

```js
class GraphNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.neighbors = [];
  }
}

let a = new GraphNode("a");
let b = new GraphNode("b");
let c = new GraphNode("c");
let d = new GraphNode("d");
let e = new GraphNode("e");
let f = new GraphNode("f");
a.neighbors = [e, c, b];
c.neighbors = [b, d];
e.neighbors = [a];
f.neighbors = [e];
```

---

### Adjacency Matrix

---

The row index will corespond to the source of an edge and the column index will correspond to the edges destination.

- When the edges have a direction, `matrix[i][j]` may not be the same as `matrix[j][i]`
- It is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself so `matrix[x][x]` is true for any node
- Will be O(n^2) space complexity

let matrix = [

|       | **A**   | **B**  | **C**  | **D**  | **E**  | **F**  |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **A** | [True,  | True,  | True,  | False, | True,  | False] |
| **B** | [False, | True,  | False, | False, | False, | False] |
| **C** | [False, | True,  | True,  | True,  | False, | False] |
| **D** | [False, | False, | False, | True,  | False, | False] |
| **E** | [True,  | False, | False, | False, | True,  | False] |
| **F** | [False, | False, | False, | False, | True,  | True]  |

];

---

### Adjacency List

---

Seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation. It uses an object where keys represent node labels and values associated with that key are the adjacent node keys held in an array.

```js
let graph = {
  a: ["b", "c", "e"],
  b: [],
  c: ["b", "d"],
  d: [],
  e: ["a"],
  f: ["e"],
};
```

---

---

## Code Examples

---

### Basic Graph Class

```js
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjList = {};
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjList[vertex]) this.adjList[vertex] = [];
  }

  addEdges(srcValue, destValue) {
    this.addVertex(srcValue);
    this.addVertex(destValue);
    this.adjList[srcValue].push(destValue);
    this.adjList[destValue].push(srcValue);
  }

  buildGraph(edges) {
    edges.forEach((ele) => {
      this.addEdges(ele[0], ele[1]);
    });
    return this.adjList;
  }

  breadthFirstTraversal(startingVertex) {
    const queue = [startingVertex];
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = new Array();

    while (queue.length) {
      const value = queue.shift();
      if (visited.has(value)) continue;
      result.push(value);
      visited.add(value);
      queue.push(...this.adjList[value]);
    }
    return result;
  }

  depthFirstTraversalIterative(startingVertex) {
    const stack = [startingVertex];
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = new Array();

    while (stack.length) {
      const value = stack.pop();
      if (visited.has(value)) continue;
      result.push(value);
      visited.add(value);
      stack.push(...this.adjList[value]);
    }
    return result;
  }

  depthFirstTraversalRecursive(
    startingVertex,
    visited = new Set(),
    vertices = []
  ) {
    if (visited.has(startingVertex)) return [];

    vertices.push(startingVertex);
    visited.add(startingVertex);

    this.adjList[startingVertex].forEach((vertex) => {
      this.depthFirstTraversalRecursive(vertex, visited, vertices);
    });
    return [...vertices];
  }
```

### Node Class Examples

```js
class GraphNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.neighbors = [];
  }
}

function breadthFirstSearch(startingNode, targetVal) {
  const queue = [startingNode];
  const visited = new Set();

  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;
    visited.add(node.val);
    if (node.val === targetVal) return node;
    node.neighbors.forEach((ele) => queue.push(ele));
  }
  return null;
}

function numRegions(graph) {
  let maxLength = 0;
  for (node in graph) {
    if (graph[node].length > maxLength) maxLength = graph[node].length;
  }
  if (maxLength === 0) {
    return (length = Object.keys(graph).length);
  } else {
    return maxLength;
  }
}

function maxValue(node, visited = new Set()) {
  let queue = [node];
  let maxValue = 0;
  while (queue.length) {
    let currentNode = queue.shift();
    if (visited.has(currentNode.val)) continue;
    visited.add(currentNode.val);
    if (currentNode.val > maxValue) maxValue = currentNode.val;
    currentNode.neighbors.forEach((ele) => queue.push(ele));
  }
  return maxValue;
}
```

### Traversal Examples

#### With Graph Node Class

```js
function depthFirstRecur(node, visited = new Set()) {
  if (visited.has(node.val)) return;

  console.log(node.val);
  visited.add(node.val);

  node.neighbors.forEach((neighbor) => {
    depthFirstRecur(neighbor, visited);
  });
}

function depthFirstIter(node) {
  let visited = new Set();
  let stack = [node];

  while (stack.length) {
    let node = stack.pop();

    if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;

    console.log(node.val);
    visited.add(node.val);

    stack.push(...node.neighbors);
  }
}
```

### With Adjacency List

```js
function depthFirst(graph) {
  let visited = new Set();

  for (let node in graph) {
    _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited);
  }
}

function _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;

  console.log(node);
  visited.add(node);

  graph[node].forEach((neighbor) => {
    _depthFirstRecur(neighbor, graph, visited);
  });
}
```

## Gulp
https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-ways-to-handle-html-includes/

Use Gulp
What's even faster than a server-side include? If the include is preprocessed before it's even on the server. Gulp has a variety of processors that can do this. One is gulp-file-include.

That would look like this:

...
<body>
   @@include('./header.html')

   Content

   @@include('./footer.html')
<form>
 <input type="button" value="Go back!" onclick="history.back()">
</form>
  </body>
...
And you'd process it like:

var fileinclude = require('gulp-file-include'),
  gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('fileinclude', function() {
  gulp.src(['index.html'])
    .pipe(fileinclude({
      prefix: '@@',
      basepath: '@file'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./'));
});
Looks like this particular plugin has fancy features where you can pass in variables to the includes, making it possible to make little data-driven components.

This is a very simple GitHub action that allows you to deploy to Heroku. The action works by running the following commands in shell via NodeJS:-

Getting Started
---------------

To get started using the action, just make sure to have a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#define-a-procfile) or a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) in your project and then create a folder called **.github** and inside it, create another folder called **workflows**. Finally inside the workflows folder, create a file called **main.yml** with the following contents:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"

Now go to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings. Scroll to the bottom until you see API Key. Copy this key and go to your project's repository on GitHub.

In your Repo, go to Settings -> Secrets and click on "New Secret". Then enter HEROKU\_API\_KEY as the name and paste the copied API Key as the value.

You can now push your project to GitHub and it will be automatically deployed to Heroku henceforth.

You learn more about GitHub Secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) and GitHub Actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Important Note
--------------

**Please Note**: Git has recently announced that it is planning to switch the default branch's name from "**master**" to "**main**". For this reason, the Action also pushes to the "**main**" branch in the heroku origin by default and if your Heroku App is still using the "**master**" branch, then the Action will automatically switch your Heroku remote to use "**main**" as the default branch. There is **No Action Needed** from you, just keep in mind that this change is occurring as you continue to use the App and if you ever need to manually deploy the App, you can do so using the following command:

git push heroku YOUR\_BRANCH:refs/heads/main

Also the `remote_branch` property no longer exists in the latest release of the Action. If you still have this as part of the `3.10.9` release. Please remove it as it may cause problems in your workflow

Options
-------

The action comes with additional options that you can use to configure your project's behavior on Heroku. You can setup these options under the "with" object as presented above:

| Name                          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                        |

Examples
--------

### Deploy with Docker

Heroku now allows users to deploy docker containers. To use this feature, simply add a Dockerfile to your project and add a `CMD` command at the end of the Dockerfile. This is the command used by heroku to start the webserver inside the container. Finally make sure to set the `usedocker` flag to true before deploying.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          usedocker: true

Keep in mind that if you deploy once using docker, the same heroku app is not compatible with a non-docker setup and similarly, you cannot deploy a dockerized setup to a non-docker heroku app.

If you need to pass in any ARGs for the Docker build, you may provide a list of arg names which automatically pull from the environment.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          usedocker: true
          docker\_build\_args: |
 NODE\_ENV
 SECRET\_KEY
        env:
          NODE\_ENV: production
          SECRET\_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY\_SECRET\_KEY }}

Also, thanks to [Olav Sundfør](https://github.com/olaven) for adding the Docker feature and [Matt Stavola](https://github.com/mbStavola) for adding the ability to pass in build args.

### Deploy with custom Buildpacks

Taken from the official heroku website:

"Heroku Buildpacks are sets of open source scripts that are used for compiling apps on Heroku. They form the backbone of Heroku's [polyglot platform](https://www.heroku.com/languages). Buildpacks enable you to extend Heroku's build system to support your language or customizations, or to make particular binary packages available to the runtime. Heroku Buildpacks give you the freedom to code in the languages and frameworks that work best for your app and your team"

To use a custom buildpack in the action, simply add the url of the buildpack to the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          buildpack: "https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git"

### Deploy Subdirectory

If you are using a complex application which has both frontend and backend applications in separate folders, you can specify a path to the directory to deploy using the **appdir** option:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          appdir: "api" # <- This will point to the api folder in your project

Thanks to [meszarosdezso](https://github.com/meszarosdezso) for adding the appdir feature

### Deploy custom branch

You can use the **branch** option to deploy an app in another branch

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          branch: "dev"

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

### Deploy custom remote branch

You can use the **remote\_branch** option to deploy an app to another remote branch

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          remote\_branch: "main"

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

Health Check
------------

Sometimes you will run into issues where the action has successfully deployed the project but because of some error in code or the like, the Heroku App crashes or fails to launch. To counter this, you can setup a healthcheck in the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"

Adding the url to the healthcheck option of the action will make the action attempt to perform a GET Request to that url and print the response if successful. Else it will fail the action to indicate that the deploy was not successful.

P.S: It is recommended that you setup a specific route such as **/health** for performing healthchecks

### Advanced Usage

Additionally, if you are using a custom route for performing healthchecks, you can check for a specific value from this url using the **checkstring** option of the action like so:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"
          checkstring: "ok"

This will essentially check if the value returned by sending a GET request to the **healthcheck** url is equal to the **checkstring**

### Adding Delay

In some cases, a healthcheck ends up being performed before the application has been setup on Heroku. To counter this, you can manually set the **delay** option in the action to make the action wait a certain period of time (in seconds) before performing the healthcheck

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"
          checkstring: "ok"
          delay: 5

By default, the delay will be 0 if you choose to not set it

### Rollback on healthcheck failure

You can set the rollbackonhealthcheckfailed option to ensure that your application is rolled back if the healthcheck fails. _.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"
          checkstring: "ok"
          rollbackonhealthcheckfailed: true

By default, the application will not be rolled back if the healthcheck fails.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Heroku offers a means of passing sensitive information to your app (such as api keys etc) via something it calls **config vars** which you can find in the settings of your heroku app. But sometimes you might want to store sensitive information (api keys etc) in GitHub Secrets instead just to ensure platform independence. If you choose to this, you can then pass those secrets to your heroku app by using the "env" object of the action:-

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
        env:
          HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY: ${{secrets.FIREBASE\_API\_KEY}}
          HD\_RANDOM\_DATA: "Hello"

Note that the variables must start with "**HD\_**". This is is important so the action can tell your environment variable apart from multiple other variables (passed by your language, github actions etc) which you probably don't want sitting in your heroku app's config vars.

On that note, if you've set these variables and have deployed your app, you can check your Heroku App's config vars and you'll find that they have been set with the env variables you have passed.

**PLEASE NOTE**: The "**HD\_**" will be scrapped from the variable your name by the action. So in your project, "**FIREBASE\_API\_KEY**" will be passed instead of "**HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY**" (for example) and you can see this if you check your Heroku App's config vars. We understand that this can be confusing but this is again to ensure Platform independence and so that you don't have to use HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY if you choose to stop using Heroku

### ENV File

You can if you wish also pass the path to an env file (with respect to your appdir path) as an option to the action. The action will then read that file and set the config vars accordingly in Heroku

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          env\_file: ".env"
        env:
          HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY: ${{secrets.FIREBASE\_API\_KEY}}
          HD\_RANDOM\_DATA: "Hello"

Example env file

    HELLO=world
    WORLD=hello
    

There are two important points to keep in mind when using the **env\_file** option.

1.  The first is that in can be used in conjunction with **env** option of the action as you have seen above
    
2.  The second is that unlike in the **env** option, you do not need to prefix the env variables in the .env file with "HD\_".
    
    (For those of you who are wondering why this is the case, when using the **env** option, the env variables are passed directly into the process along with all the other env variables passed by GitHub Actions, the language you are using etc and the "HD\_" in that case is to help differentiate your env variables from them. But when using a file to pass the env variables, the action manually reads the file so there is no chance of stray env variables being passed by your language, github actions etc and hence no need to add the "HD\_")
    

Also note that using a file (which can be named anything so long as it follows the format of a standard env file) can be useful if you're trying to send a very large number of env variables to Heroku, it does mean that keeping the .env file secure and private is entirely in your hands so tread with caution.

Procfile Passing
----------------

In some cases, you might want to be able to set the Procfile within the action itself instead of declaring it manually in your project. Although this approach is not recommended in favor of just using multiple branches, it might still be useful in some edge cases. You can set the Procfile in the action by using the **procfile** option of the action like so:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          procfile: "web: npm start"

Keep in mind this won't work if you are using Docker.

Deploying to a team
-------------------

If you are an enterprise user and wish to deploy your app to a specific team, you can do so by just passing the **team** option to the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME"
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          team: "THE TEAM's NAME"

Just Login
----------

GitHub Actions does come with the heroku cli pre-installed (this is what is used by the Action to deploy applications). So if you wish to use the heroku cli and just need to login, you can use the **justlogin** option of the Heroku Deploy Action

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: ""
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          justlogin: true
      - run: heroku auth:whoami

Important Notes
---------------

*   You can check this repo's [_.github/workflows/main.yml_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) for example use cases of the action in use. Additionally the APIs for these use cases can be found in the [_tests_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/tree/master/tests) folder of the repo
    
*   You can find the secrets tab in your project's settings
    
*   Be careful with your appname, cuz the action either deploys to an existing app or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. So if you accidently change it after deploying it once already, the action won't fail, it'll just create a new dyno and if you are on a paid plan, heroku can be expensive. On that note, always check the logs of your actions to make sure everything is A-OK.
    
*   If you're using the above exact workflow code, keep in mind that it deploys whenever you make a change to the master branch (Even README updates which have nothing to do with application code) and that might not be very efficient for you, have a look through the github actions docs to customize when the action should trigger.
    
    (I would recommend making a separate dev branch and setting up the action to trigger upon pull request to the master branch)
    
*   By default, if you don't specify a branch in your action, it will default to the HEAD branch (or whichever branch the action is defined under). So you might be wondering what happens if you define the same action in a different branch under the same heroku app name (or which you try to deploy to the same appname from a different branch)? The answer is that the new branch overrides whatever your old branch was (even if the new branch is behind the old branch in terms of commits unless you set dontuseforce to true)

### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/intro-2-js.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/intro-2-js.md)

## V1 - Getting started

* Arrays are lists: `['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']`.
* Variables are nicknames for data: `var todos = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']`.
* Semicolons act sort of like periods do in English. They don't appear at the end of every line though.
* Proper semicolon usage is particularly important when you are saving to a file, so pay close attention to how I use semicolons in `todoList.html`. I'll note exceptions as we get to them.
* You can ignore my semicolon usage in the console since I treat that environment like a temporary scratchpad/whiteboard.
* Use `console.log` to display data in the console. Example: `console.log('hi hi hi!')`.
* Computers start counting from 0, not 1.
* On an array, use `.push` to add data to the end of the array. Example: `myArray.push('new data')`.
* Get an element at a certain position: `array[position]`.
* Change an element at a certain position: `array[position] = 'changed!`.
* Remove an element at a certain position: `array.splice(position, 1)`.

## Functions - Interlude

* Characteristic 1: Functions group multiple lines of code together under a single name.

```javascript
// Declaring a function.
function functionName() {
  // Body of function. You can put 0 or more 
  // lines of code between the curly braces.
}

// To run the function, add a set of parentheses to the function name.
functionName();
```

* Characteristic 2: When you a run a function, you can provide the function with data.

```javascript
// myData is a parameter. Parameters differ from variables in two ways:
// 1. Parameters are declared at the same time a function is created.
// 2. Parameters are assigned a value only when the function is run.
function demoFunction(myData) {
  console.log(myData);
}

demoFunction('gordon'); // myData = 'gordon'
demoFunction('watch and code'); // myData = 'watch and code'

// Notice that we do NOT use semicolons after the opening 
// and closing curly braces in function declarations.
```

## V2 - Using functions

* Functions can have 0, 1, or *more* parameters.

```javascript
function edit(position, newValue) {
  todos[position] = newValue;
  console.log(todos);
}
```

## The computer's perspective - Interlude

* To understand the computer's perspective, you need to understand every little thing that happens in each line of code. To do this, you must learn how to use the debugger effectively.
* When I see the "Step over" button, I think "step over to next line of code that's about to run".
* When you hit "Step over", you will not necessarily go to the next line of code in the file. You have to think about what will happen.
* The "Resume script execution" is sorta of like an unpause button. It'll exit the debugger or go to the next breakpoint (if there is one).
* Delusional thinking is not compatible with success (programming or otherwise).
* Use the expectations/reality framework (along with the debugger) to improve the quality of your thinking.
* Use "Step into" to go into any function call *except* built-in functions.
* Use the `debugger` statement to set breakpoints in the console without writing to a file. 

## Questions and quality - Interlude 

* Ask high quality questions. How you approach this will be a deciding factor in how good you will be.
* Throughout your journey learning to program (or with anything really), you will be faced with choices like this. One path leads to high ability, the other path leads to low ability. Choose wisely.

## Functions and variables - Interlude

* If you're inside of a function, you can look out and see data, but the opposite isn't true. If you're outside, you can't look in.
* Whenever you're in doubt, draw circles and arrows. Arrows can only exit circles; they can never go in.
* "Scope" is a fancy term for describing variable visibility.

## V3 - Using objects

* `true` and `false` are boolean values.
* Use objects to group related data together

```javascript
var todo = {
  todoText: 'Get groceries',
  completed: false
};

// Access properties with dot notation.
console.log(todo.todoText); // 'Get groceries'
console.log(todo.completed); // false
```

## V4 - Toggling
* Comparisons: Use `===` to see if two things are equal to each other.
* Use if statements to conditionally run chunks of code.
```javascript
if (true) {
  console.log('This line of code will run.');
}

if (false) {
  console.log('This line of code will not run.');
}

// Notice that we do NOT use semicolons after the opening 
// and closing curly braces in if statements.

```
* `if/else` statements offer another way to structure conditional logic.
```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Will run if condition is true.
} else {
  // Will run if condition is false.
} 
```

## Data types and comparisons - Interlude

* JavaScript has two broad types of data, objects and primitives.
* Objects can be as complex as you want. Examples include arrays and functions.
* Primitives are the simple building blocks of the language.
* There are five main primitives: strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
* Comparisons with primitives work how most people would expect (like math class).
* Comparisons with objects work very differently.
* Make sure you understand why `[1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3]` is `false`.

## V5 - Displaying data better

* Use a for-loop to repeat a piece of code any number of times.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  // 0
  // 1
  // 2
  // 3
  // 4
}

// Notice that we do NOT use semicolons after the opening 
// and closing curly braces in for-loops.
```

## V6 - Toggle all

* Boolean logic can be complicated. Make sure that you carefully think about different situations before you start coding. 

## V7 - Buttons!

* HTML syntax for buttons: `<button>My button</button>`.
* Vocab lesson: A function on an object is called a "method".
```javascript
var gordon = { 
  name: 'Gordon',                  // property
  city: 'San Francisco',           // property
  myMethod: function sayHi() {     // method
    console.log('Hi');
  }
};
```
* Use the `document` object to access the webpage in your JavaScript.
* Use the `document.getElementById` method to grab an element by id.
```javascript
var displayTodosButton = document.getElementById('display-todos-button');
```
* Elements have a `addEventListener` method, which can be used to respond to events.
```javascript
// The first argument is an event type.
// The second argument is a function that'll run 
// whenever the event occurs on the element.
// In this example, whenever the displayTodosButton is clicked,
// the displayTodos function will run.
displayTodosButton.addEventListener('click', displayTodos);
```

## Experimenting with functions - Interlude
* You need to get to the point where the results of these experiments are obvious and familiar to you.
```javascript
function demoFunction() {}

var experiment1 = demoFunction;   // ?
var experiment2 = demoFunction(); // ?

function demoFunctionThatReturnsAString() {
  return 'a string';
}
 
var experiment3 = demoFunctionThatReturnsAString;   // ?
var experiment4 = demoFunctionThatReturnsAString(); // ?

function demoFunctionThatReturnsUndefined() {
  return undefined;
}

var experiment5 = demoFunctionThatReturnsUndefined;   // ?
var experiment6 = demoFunctionThatReturnsUndefined(); // ?

function logThis(thing) {
  console.log(thing);
}

// Experiment 7
logThis(demoFunctionThatReturnsAString);   // ?

// Experiment 8
logThis(demoFunctionThatReturnsAString()); // ?
```

## V8 - Getting data from inputs

* In your HTML, use `<input>` to get user input.
* In your JavaScript, use `input.value` to get/set an input's value.

## V9 - Escape from the console

* In HTML, use `ul`s and `li`s for listing data.
```
<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ul>
```
* Use `document.createElement` to create elements in JavaScript.
```javascript
var todoLi = document.createElement('li');
```
* Use the `appendChild` method to add elements to the page.
```javascript
var todosUl = document.getElementById('todos-ul');
todosUl.appendChild(todoLi);
```
* Use the `innerHTML` property to get/set an element's html.
* Use the `innerText` property to get/set an element's text.
* Use `+` to combine strings. 

## V10 - Click to delete
* Went through the pros/cons of different ways to access the remove button that was clicked. Making informed tradeoffs is one of the most important skills that you will learn.
* Functions passed to `addEventListener` are called with an event object, which describes the event that occurred.
```javascript
function remove(event) {
  // We used event.currentTarget to access the remove button element that was clicked.
  // Elements have an id property we can use to get/set the id.
  var position = event.currentTarget.id;
  todos.splice(position, 1);
  displayTodos();
}
```

## V11 - Click to toggle

* Element ids should be unique.
* Practiced thinking through the pros/cons of different ways to extract position from ids.
```javascript
// We ended up choosing this technique.
var idString = 'todo-0';
var position = idString.split('-')[1];
```

## V12 - Click to edit

* `prompt()` is a simple way to get user input.
* Use `!==` to test for inequality.
* Use `&&` to combine comparisons.

#JavaScript Array

  

### What are JavaScript Arrays?

```js

2Array.prototype.push()

3Array.prototype.indexOf()

4Array.prototype.slice()

5Array.prototype.toString()

6Array.prototype.filter()

7Array.prototype.join()

8Array.prototype.splice()

9Array.prototype.forEach()

10Array.prototype.concat()

11Array.prototype.shift()

12Array.prototype.unshift()

13Array.prototype.map()

14Array.prototype.sort()

15Array.prototype.pop()

16Array.prototype.reduce()

17Array.prototype.some()

18Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()

19Array.prototype.reduceRight()

20Array.prototype.every()

21Array.prototype.reverse()

```

  
  
  
  
  
  

## In JavaScript, an Array represents an ordered collection of values.

  

>The array consists of one or more elements, each having a numbered position inside of the array. This is also called the index. Any given array element can hold any type offered by the JavaScript language. In other words, you can mix and match the various types inside of the same array. Just like most programming languages, arrays in JavaScript are zero based. This means they start at 0 and move up from there. Arrays in JavaScript grow and shrink like magic. That is to say, you do not have to specify the array size ahead of time before placing values in the array. As you add elements, the array dynamically grows for you. The same happens when you remove elements. All JavaScript arrays have a link to Array.prototype which is how we get access to all of the very useful functions we'll cover here in this tutorial. In true JavaScript style, these functions work not only on any array, but also any "array-like" object.

  

## 2. Array.prototype.push()

  

>array.push(element1, …, elementN)

  

#### Overview

>The push() function appends the arguments given to it, in order, to the end of the array. It modifies the array directly, rather than creating a new array.

  

#### What push() returns

>When you make a call to push(), it returns the total number of items in the array, after any provided arguments have been added to the end of the array.

  

#### array.push() function examples

`

``js

let characters = ['Darth Vader', 'Yoda', 'Boba Fett'];

  

let total = characters.push('Luke Skywalker', 'Han Solo');

  

console.log(characters); // ["Darth Vader", "Yoda", "Boba Fett", "Luke Skywalker", "Han Solo"]

  

console.log(total); // 5

```

  

3. Array.prototype.indexOf()

array.indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex = 0,fromIndex=0)

  

Overview

The JavaScript indexOf() function searches an array for an element that contains a specific value, then returns the very first index that contains that value. You can provide a starting index to the function if you like, otherwise searching will begin from index 0.

  

What indexOf() returns

The lowest index that is greater than or equal to the start of the array at which the element is equal to the given value. If no match is found, the indexOf() function returns -1.

  

array.indexOf() function examples

let starwars = ['Episode 4: A New Hope',

  

'Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back',

  

'Episode 6: Return of the Jedi',

  

'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace',

  

'Episode 2: Attack of the Clones',

  

'Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith',

  

'Episode 7: The Force Awakens'];

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 7: The Force Awakens')); // 6

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith')); // 5

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 2: Attack of the Clones', 3)); // 4

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 1: The Phantom Menace', -4)); // 3

  

let locatedat = [];

  

let enemies = ['Kylo Ren', 'Darth Vader', 'Storm Trooper', 'General Hux', 'Emperor Palpatine', 'Storm Trooper'];

  

let enemy = 'Storm Trooper';

  

let enemylocation = enemies.indexOf(enemy);

  

while (enemylocation != -1) {

  

locatedat.push(enemylocation);

  

enemylocation = enemies.indexOf(enemy, enemylocation + 1);

  

}

  

console.log(locatedat); // 2, 5

  

The example above is a little more tricky. We have an array of enemies, and there might be multiple of a given enemy. By making use of indexOf(), we can find all instances of 'Storm Trooper' in our array of enemies. Running the code shows us that we have found a Storm Trooper at index 2 and index 5 of our array.

  

function theGoodSide(goodguys, goodguy) {

  

if (goodguys.indexOf(goodguy) === -1) {

  

goodguys.push(goodguy);

  

console.log('The new goodguys are ' + goodguys);

  

} else if (goodguys.indexOf(goodguy) > -1) {

  

console.log(goodguy + ' is already part of the goodguys.');

  

}

  

}

  

let thegoodguys = ['Luke Skywalker', 'Han Solo', 'Princess Leia'];

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Han Solo'); // Han Solo is already part of the goodguys.

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Yoda'); // The new goodguys are Luke Skywalker,Han Solo,Princess Leia,Yoda

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Ben Kenobi'); // The new goodguys are Luke Skywalker,Han Solo,Princess Leia,Yoda,Ben Kenobi

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'R2-D2'); // The new goodguys are Luke Skywalker,Han Solo,Princess Leia,Yoda,Ben Kenobi,R2-D2

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Luke Skywalker'); // Luke Skywalker is already part of the goodguys.

  

This example makes use of a custom function that we can use to make sure our good guys are all accounted for. We check to see if the character exists in our collection, and if not, we add them to our good side.

  

4. Array.prototype.slice()

array.slice(ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 6: begin\̲[̲, end])

  

Overview

The JavaScript slice() function takes a start and end argument. It uses these start and end points to reach into the array, and remove a specific number of elements. The position you reference by start is included in the results, but the end is not included. In other words all elements are returned from the start right up to, but not including the end element. If you do not provide an end value, slice() will return the rest of the array starting from the given starting point. The original array is left in tact.

  

What slice() returns

The slice() function returns a new array that contains all of the elements of the original array from the element specified by the starting point provided, and up to but not including, the element specified by the ending point provided.

  

array.slice() function examples

let vaderparts = ['helmet', 'left arm', 'right arm', 'left leg', 'right leg'];

  

let chopped = vaderparts.slice(2,3);

  

console.log(chopped); // right arm

  

5. Array.prototype.toString()

array.toString()

  

The toString() function converts all elements in an array to strings and outputs one big string as a comma separated list of items.

  

array.toString() function examples

let spacecraft = ['X Wing', 'Death Star', 'Millenium Falcon', 'Jedi Interceptor'];

  

let allspacecraft = spacecraft.toString();

  

console.log(allspacecraft);

  

// X Wing,Death Star,Millenium Falcon,Jedi Interceptor

  

6. Array.prototype.filter()

array.filter(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

The JavaScript filter() function is very useful for doing exactly what it says, filtering down a collection of elements based on a given test. When you call the filter() function, you need to pass it a callback. This callback is executed against every element in the array. If that callback results in a true value, that particular element is added to a new array. The original array is left unchanged.

  

What filter() returns

filter() returns a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that returned true when the provided callback ran.

  

array.filter() function examples

let summer = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80].filter(function niceweather(temperature) {

  

return temperature >= 70;

  

});

  

console.log(summer); // 70, 80

  
  
  

let spacecraft = [

  

{name: 'Tie Fighter', speed: 200000},

  

{name: 'Super Star Destroyer', speed: 300000},

  

{name: 'Death Star', speed: 400000},

  

{name: 'T65 X Wing Star fighter', speed: 500000},

  

{name: 'T47 Air (snow) Speeder', speed: 600000},

  

{name: '74-Z Speeder Bike', speed: 700000},

  

{name: 'Millenium Falcon', speed: 800000}

  

];

  

function filterBySpeed(spacecraft) {

  

return spacecraft.speed > 450000;

  

}

  

let fleet = spacecraft.filter(filterBySpeed);

  

fleet.forEach(function (craft) {

  

console.log(craft.name);

  

});

  

// T65 X Wing Star fighter

  

// T47 Air (snow) Speeder

  

// 74-Z Speeder Bike

  

// Millenium Falcon

  

7. Array.prototype.join()

string = array.join(separator = ','separator=′,′)

  

Overview

The join() function converts each element of an array to a string and then concatenates those strings together. If the separator string was provided, it gets inserted between all elements in the final string.

  

What join() returns

The string that results from converting each element of the original array to a string and then joining them together, with the separator string between elements.

  

array.join() function examples

let wisdom = ['Yoda Says', 'Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.'];

  

wisdom = wisdom.join(': ');

  

console.log(wisdom);

  

// Yoda Says: Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

  

let wisdom = ['Do. Or do not. There is no try', 'Luminous beings are we…not this crude matter', 'Wars not make one great', 'Judge me by my size, do you?', 'Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is'];

  

let wisdom = wisdom.join(' <=***=> ');

  

console.log(wisdom);

  

// Do. Or do not. There is no try <=***=> Luminous beings are we…not this crude matter <=***=> Wars not make one great <=***=> Judge me by my size, do you? <=***=> Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is

  

years = [1977, 1980, 1983, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2015];

  

years = years.join(', ');

  

console.log('New Star Wars movies came out in ' + years);

  

// New Star Wars movies came out in 1977, 1980, 1983, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2015

  

8. Array.prototype.splice()

array.splice(start, deleteCountParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 8: , item1\̲[̲, item2\[, …]])

  

Overview

The splice() function deletes zero or more elements beginning from the provided start location, and replaces those elements with zero or more new values that were provided. Existing items in the array are shifted as needed to make room for any added or deleted elements. The thing to remember about the splice() function, is that it does modify the original array directly.

  

Returns

An array which contains any elements that may have been deleted from the array.

  

array.splice() function examples

  

```js

let darkSide = ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Boba Fett', 'Emperor Palpatine'];

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 0 elements from index 2, and inserts 'Jabba the Hutt'

  

let removed = darkSide.splice(2, 0, 'Jabba the Hutt');

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Jabba the Hutt', 'Boba Fett', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// [], no elements removed

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 1 element from index 3

  

removed = darkSide.splice(3, 1);

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Jabba the Hutt', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Boba Fett']

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 1 element from index 2, and inserts 'Darth Maul'

  

removed = darkSide.splice(2, 1, 'Darth Maul');

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Darth Maul', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Jabba the Hutt']

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 2 elements from index 0, and inserts 'Count Dooku', 'General Grievous' and 'Asajj Ventress'

  

removed = darkSide.splice(0, 2, 'Count Dooku', 'General Grievous', 'Asajj Ventress');

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Count Dooku', 'General Grievous', 'Asajj Ventress', 'Darth Maul', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin']

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 2 elements from index 3

  

removed = darkSide.splice(3, darkSide.length);

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Count Dooku', 'General Grievous', 'Asajj Ventress']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Darth Maul', 'Emperor Palpatine']

```

  

# 9. Array.prototype.forEach()

array.forEach(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

### Overview

>The forEach() function executes a provided function on each element of the array. forEach() has no return value and does not return the original array. forEach() is related to the map(), filter(), every(), and some() functions and as such they share some related details. They all expect a callback function as the first argument. The optional second argument is a way to specify the this value for the callback function. All of these functions check the length of the array before looping. If the provided callback adds elements to the array during it's execution, those elements are not included for looping by the forEach(). Also of interesting note is that if the callback changes values in the original array before they are looped over, those changed values will be passed during their callback execution. You can also check out the Higher Order Functions In JavaScript tutorial.

10. Array.prototype.concat()

let new_array = old_array.concat(value1ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 9: , value2\̲[̲, …\[, valueN]])

  

Overview

concat() is a function that creates a new array which is the result of adding the supplied arguments to the original array. The original array is left intact, and the new array is the original plus any added elements. If any of the arguments to the concat() function are themselves an array, then the elements of that supplied array are added, rather than the entire array itself.

  

Returns

A new array, which is created by adding each of the supplied arguments to the original array.

  

array.concat() function examples

let legoStarWarsGames = ['Empire Vs Rebels', 'Ultimate Rebel', 'The Quest for R2-D2'];

  

let legoStarWarsSets = [10188, 75111, 75110, 75109];

  

let gamesAndSets = legoStarWarsGames.concat(legoStarWarsSets);

  

console.log(gamesAndSets);

  

// ["Empire Vs Rebels", "Ultimate Rebel", "The Quest for R2-D2", 10188, 75111, 75110, 75109]

  

let legoStarWarsGames = ['Empire Vs Rebels', 'Ultimate Rebel', 'The Quest for R2-D2'];

  

let legoStarWarsSets = [10188, 75111, 75110, 75109];

  

let availablePlatforms = ['Wii', 'Xbox', 'Playstation'];

  

let gamesSetsPlatforms = legoStarWarsGames.concat(legoStarWarsSets, availablePlatforms);

  

console.log(gamesSetsPlatforms);

  

// ["Empire Vs Rebels", "Ultimate Rebel", "The Quest for R2-D2", 10188, 75111, 75110, 75109, "Wii", "Xbox", "Playstation"]

  

11. Array.prototype.shift()

array.shift()

  

Overview

The shift() function removes and returns the first element of the original array. All remaining elements in the array get shifted one slot to the left in order to fill the hole created by removing the first element. If you try to apply this function to an empty array, it will do nothing and simply return undefined. The shift() function does not create a new array, it modifies the original array directly.

  

Returns

shift() returns the first element from the original array.

  

array.shift() function examples

let starWarsCreatures = ['Tach', 'Kath hound', 'Ruggers', 'Spice spider'];

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures before: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// "starWarsCreatures before: Tach,Kath hound,Ruggers,Spice spider"

  

let shifted = starWarsCreatures.shift();

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// "starWarsCreatures after: Kath hound,Ruggers,Spice spider"

  

console.log('Removed this element: ' + shifted);

  

// "Removed this element: Tach"

  

12. Array.prototype.unshift()

array.unshift(ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 9: element1\̲[̲, …\[, elementN]])

  

Overview

A direct opposite to the shift() function which we just discussed, is the unshift() function. unshift() inserts any arguments you pass to it into the beginning of the array. All of the existing elements need to shift to the right in order to make room for the new elements. Each argument passed to unshift() gets added in order starting from index 0. In addition, unshift() is modifying the original array directly.

  

Returns

The new length of the array.

  

array.unshift() function examples

let starWarsCreatures = ['Eopie', 'Acklay', 'Talortai', 'Boma'];

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures before: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures before: Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

let newcount = starWarsCreatures.unshift('Climbing tauntaun');

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures after: Climbing tauntaun,Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

console.log('The array now has: ' + newcount + ' elements');

  

// The array now has: 5 elements

  



  

21

  

let starWarsCreatures = ['Eopie', 'Acklay', 'Talortai', 'Boma'];

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures before: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures before: Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

let newcount = starWarsCreatures.unshift('Climbing tauntaun');

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures after: Climbing tauntaun,Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

console.log('The array now has: ' + newcount + ' elements');

  

// The array now has: 5 elements

  

newcount = starWarsCreatures.unshift(['Gullipuds', 'Mynock']);

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures after: Gullipuds,Mynock,Climbing tauntaun,Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

console.log('The array now has: ' + newcount + ' elements');

  

// The array now has: 6 elements

  

13. Array.prototype.map()

array.map(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

This is a very useful JavaScript function, and made use of all the time in professional software. The map() function loops over every element in the array, executing a callback function on each item. Once map() has completed looping through the array, it takes the results from each callback applied to each element, and returns those results in their entirety as an array. You are left with a new array with updated values, and an old array which has the original values. These two arrays are equal in length. When the callback is invoked, it is done so with three arguments. Those are the value of the element, the index of the element, and the Array object being traversed. If the optional second parameter is provided to map(), it will be used as the this value for each execution of the callback.

  

note: The map() and forEach() functions seem like they are the same, but they are in fact different. The difference is that forEach() iterates over an array and applies some operation with side effects to each array member such as saving each one to the database, or some other side effect. map() on the other hand iterates over an array, updates each member of that array, and returns another array of the same size with the transformed members (such as converting an array of strings to all lowercase).

  

Returns

map() returns a new array with elements computed by the provided callback function.

  

array.map() function examples

let starwars = ['star wars', 'the phantom menace', 'the force awakens'];

  

let swModified = starwars.map(function (element) {

  

return element.toUpperCase();

  

});

  

console.log(swModified);

  

// ["STAR WARS", "THE PHANTOM MENACE", "THE FORCE AWAKENS"]

  

let one = [3, 5, 7];

  

let two = one.map(function (number) {

  

return number * number;

  

});

  

console.log(one); // [3, 5, 7]

  

console.log(two); // [9, 25, 49]

  

let str = 'The Clone Wars';

  

let arr = Array.prototype.map.call(str, function (el) {

  

return el;

  

});

  

console.log(str); // The Clone Wars

  

console.log(arr); // ["T", "h", "e", " ", "C", "l", "o", "n", "e", " ", "W", "a", "r", "s"]

  

14. Array.prototype.sort()

array.sort(compareFunctioncompareFunction)

  

Overview

If you want to sort an array in JavaScript, then you can do so with the built in sort() function. sort() applies the sort directly to the original array, no copy of the array is made. You can optionally provide a callback function that will determine the behavior of the sort. If you do not provide one, the sort() function will first convert all elements to strings, and then sort based on something called the Unicode code point value. Basically that means alphabetical, but with some special rules such as capital letters coming before lowercase.

  

Returns

sort() returns a reference to the original array.

  

array.sort() function examples



  

21

  

let creatures = ['Pug jumper', 'Rong boars', 'Wamba', 'Oslet'];

  

creatures.sort(); //

  

let nums = [1, 10, 2, 21, 33, 04, 12, 09, 300];

  

nums.sort(); // [1, 10, 2, 21]

  

// Watch out that 10 comes before 2,

  

// because '10' comes before '2' in Unicode code point order.

  

let spacecraft = ['Lambda Class Shuttle', 'imperial landing craft', '4 Tantive'];

  

spacecraft.sort();

  

// In Unicode, numbers come before upper case letters,

  

// which come before lower case letters.

  

console.log(creatures);

  

// ["Oslet", "Pug jumper", "Rong boars", "Wamba"]

  

console.log(nums);

  

// [1, 10, 12, 2, 21, 300, 33, 4, 9]

  

console.log(spacecraft);

  

// ["4 Tantive", "Lambda Class Shuttle", "imperial landing craft"]

  

As we can see from the above example, when you do not supply a callback function to the sort method, ordering may not be what you expect. The rules for ordering in Unicode are a bit unique. For example, numbers come before upper case letters and uppercase letters come before lowercase letters. In addition, an array of numbers is converted to strings before sorting, so this is why we see 33 coming before 4 and 9 in the example above. Here is a callback function example to show ordering numbers how you might expect.

  

let nums = [1, 10, 2, 21, 33, 04, 12, 09, 300];

  

nums.sort(numsasexpected);

  

function numsasexpected(one, two) {

  

return one - two;

  

}

  

console.log(nums);

  

// [1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 21, 33, 300]

  

15. Array.prototype.pop()

array.pop()

  

Overview

The opposite of the push() function would be the pop() function. The pop() function removes the last element from an array, decrements the length of the array, and returns the value which was removed from the array. If you try to apply the pop() to an empty array, you will simply get undefined returned.

  

Returns

pop() returns the last element of the array it is called on.

  

array.pop() function examples



  

let usefulFunctions = ['push', 'indexOf', 'slice', 'toString', 'filter', 'join'];

  

console.log('usefulFunctions initially has: ' + usefulFunctions);

  

// usefulFunctions initially has: push,indexOf,slice,toString,filter,join

  

let firstpop = usefulFunctions.pop();

  

console.log('after one pop, usefulFunctions has: ' + usefulFunctions);

  

// after one pop, usefulFunctions has: push,indexOf,slice,toString,filter

  

let poptwo = usefulFunctions.pop();

  

console.log('after two pops, usefulFunctions has: ' + usefulFunctions);

  

// after two pops, usefulFunctions has: push,indexOf,slice,toString

  

console.log('popone contains: ' + firstpop);

  

// popone contains: join

  

console.log('poptwo contains: ' + poptwo);

  

// poptwo contains: filter

  

16. Array.prototype.reduce()

array.reduce(callback, initialValue,initialValue)

  

Overview

reduce() accepts a function as the first parameter which acts like a binary operator. This callback function takes two values, operates on them, and returns a result. The number of times the callback function runs is always one less than the total length of the original array. For example if the original array has a length of 10, the callback will run 9 times. The final result is one combined value.

  

Returns

The reduced value of the array, which is the return value of the last time the callback function is executed.

  

array.reduce() function examples

In this example, we will use array.reduce() to operate on values contained within a simple array of objects. array.reduce() is a little more challenging than some of the other useful array functions, so spend some extra time on this one if it doesn't click immediately.

+ workersByCategory['Content'] + ' working in Content production!'

  

);

  

// We have 3 employees in Web Design, 2 in Web Development, and 2 working in Content production!

  

17. Array.prototype.some()

array.some(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

As we can see from the signature above, the some() function takes a callback as the first argument, and an optional second argument. The second argument, if provided, specifies the this value for invocations of the supplied callback. The some() function runs the provided callback on each element in the array, and if the callback returns true, then the some() function stops right away and returns true. If all callback iterations return false, then some() returns false.

  

Returns

some() either returns true or false. At least one item in the array must return true when the callback is applied in order for some() to return true.

  

array.some() function examples

function jsarrayfuncs(element, index, array) {

  

return element === 'javascript array functions';

  

}

  

let one = ['the good parts', 'the better parts', 'has no parts', 'atwood loves php'];

  

let two = ['life is good', 'arrays for all', 'node for win', 'javascript array functions'];

  

console.log(one.some(jsarrayfuncs)); // false

  

console.log(two.some(jsarrayfuncs)); // true

  

18. Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()

array.lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex = arr.length – 1,fromIndex=arr.length–1)

  

Overview

The lastIndexOf() function searches through an array backwards for a supplied value. Once the function finds that value, it returns the index position of where that value exists in the array. If you provide the optional second argument to the lastIndexOf() function, searching will begin from that starting point and go backwards. If you do not supply this second argument, searching starts at the end of the array. If no match is found, -1 is returned.

  

Returns

The highest index position that is less than or equal to the start of the array where the element is === to the value you are looking for, or -1 if there are no matches found.

  

array.lastIndexOf() function examples

let starwars = ['Episode 4: A New Hope',

  

'Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back',

  

'Episode 6: Return of the Jedi',

  

'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace',

  

'Episode 2: Attack of the Clones',

  

'Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith',

  

'Episode 7: The Force Awakens'];

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 7: The Force Awakens')); // 6

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith')); // 5

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 2: Attack of the Clones', 3)); // -1

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 1: The Phantom Menace', -4)); // 3

  

let locatedat = [];

  

let enemies = ['Kylo Ren', 'Darth Vader', 'Storm Trooper', 'General Hux', 'Emperor Palpatine', 'Storm Trooper'];

  

let enemy = 'Storm Trooper';

  

let enemylocation = enemies.lastIndexOf(enemy);

  

while (enemylocation != -1) {

  

locatedat.push(enemylocation);

  

enemylocation = enemies.lastIndexOf(enemy, enemylocation - 1);

  

}

  

console.log(locatedat); // 5, 2

  

19. Array.prototype.reduceRight()

array.reduceRight(callback, initialValue,initialValue)

  

Overview

The reduceRight() function works just like reduce() with one key difference. reduceRight() enumerates array elements from right to left (from highest index to lowest) rather than left to right (lowest to highest).

  

array.reduceRight() function example

let sum = [0, 10, 20, 30].reduceRight(function (one, two) {

  

return one + two;

  

});

  

console.log(sum); // 60

  

let flat = [[0, 10], [20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4]], [40, 50]].reduceRight(function (one, two) {

  

return one.concat(two);

  

}, []);

  

console.log(flat);

  

// [40, 50, 20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4], 0, 10]

  

20. Array.prototype.every()

array.every(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

You can use the every() function to test whether a condition is true for all elements in an array. As like with most looping functions in JavaScript, you are expected to provide a callback function which will run on each element in the array from lowest to highest index. If all iterations return true when the callback runs, then the every() function itself will return true. If however an interation of the callback returns a false value, then every() stops right away and returns false.

  

array.every() function example

function greaterThan100(element, index, array) {

  

return element > 100;

  

}

  

arr1 = [200, 150, 550, 300, 101];

  

arr2 = [330, 120, 100, 508, 102];

  

console.log(arr1.every(greaterThan100)); // true

  

console.log(arr2.every(greaterThan100)); // false

  

Array.prototype.reverse()

array.reverse()

  

Overview

The reverse() function does exactly what you think it would do. It reverses the order of the elements of they array it is applied to. The reverse() function does this right on the original array, no new array is created or returned. In addition keep in mind that if there are many references to a particular array in your program, and you reverse that array, all references now also see an array which has been reversed. Perhaps that is why this function appears lower on our most useful JavaScript array functions list. Remember, the lower on the list a function appears, the less times we found it in use in popular open source software.

  

array.reverse() function example

let javascriptArray = ['eat', 'sleep', 'breathe', 'javascript'];

  

javascriptArray.reverse();

  

console.log(javascriptArray);

  

// ["javascript", "breathe", "sleep", "eat"]

  

Most Useful JavaScript Array Functions Summary

In this episode we took a look at all of the many useful JavaScript Array Functions you're likely to make use of and find helpful during your JavaScript programming. We used a method of analyzing popular JavaScript source code repositories hosted on Github, the well known open source software sharing and collaboration website. We found that the most useful JavaScript functions according to the number of times they were used in popular JavaScript frameworks to be Array.push(), Array.indexOf(), Array.slice(), Array.toString(), Array.filter(), Array.join(), Array.splice(), Array.forEach(), Array.concat(), Array.shift(), Array.unshift(), Array.map(), Array.sort(), Array.pop(), Array.reduce(), Array.some(), Array.lastIndexOf(), Array.reduceRight(), Array.every(), and finally, Array.reverse(). It would make sense to memorize as many of these as you can, or at least be very familiar with the ones that appear at the top of the list.

### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/postgres-setup.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/postgres-setup.md)




You will install three pieces of software so that you can start using PostgreSQL. You will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will install `psql` in your Ubuntu installation. Then you will also install Postbird, a cross-platform graphical user interface that makes working with SQL and PostgreSQL better than just using the command line tool `psql`.

When you read "installation", that means the actual OS that's running on your machine. So, you have a Windows installation, Windows 10, that's running when you boot your computer. Then, when you start the Ubuntu installation, it's as if there's a completely separate computer running inside your computer. It's like having two completely different laptops.

## Installing PostgreSQL 12

To install PostgreSQL 12, you need to download the installer from the Internet. PostgreSQL's commercial company, Enterprise DB, offers installers for PostgreSQL for every major platform.

Open [https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Click the link for PostgreSQL 12 for Windows x86-64.

![Download PostgreSQL](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/download-postgresql.png)

Once that installer downloads, run it. You need to go through the normal steps of installing software.

- Yes, Windows, let the installer make changes to _my_ device.
- Thanks for the welcome. Next.
- Yeah, that's a good place to install it. Next.
- I don't want that pgAdmin nor the Stack Builder things. Uncheck. Uncheck. Next.

  ![Deselect pgAdmin 4 and Stack Builder components](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postgresql-installation-uncheck-components.png)

- Also, great looking directory. Thanks. Next.
- Oooh! A password! I'll enter **\*\*\*\***. I sure won't forget that because, if I do, I'll have to uninstall and reinstall PostgreSQL and lose all of my hard work. **Seriously, write down this password or use one you will not forget.** Next.
- Sure. 5432. Good to go. Next.
- Not even sure what that means. Default! Next.
- Yep. Looks good. Next.
- Geez. Really? Thanks. Next.
- _Time to get a tea._
- All right! All done. Finish!

## Installing PostgreSQL Client Tools on Ubuntu

Now, to install the PostgreSQL Client tools for Ubuntu. You need to do this so that the Node.js (and later Python) programs running on your Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on your Windows installation. You need to tell `apt`, the package manager, that you want it to go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package repositories. You do that by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn't running, start one.)

**Pro-tip**: Copy those commands because you're not going to type them, right? After you copy one of them, you can just right-click on the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for you.

    wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

If prompted for your password, type it.

    echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

The last line of output of those two commands running should read "OK". If it does not, try copying and pasting them one at a time.

Now that you've registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look for PostgreSQL, you need to update the `apt` registry. You should do this before you install _any_ software on Ubuntu.

    sudo apt update

Once that's finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be in the repository. Now, you can install them with the following command.

    sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common

If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it "Y".

Test that it installed by typing `psql --version`. You should see it print out information about the version of the installed tools. If it tells you that it can't find the command, try these instructions over.

## Configuring the client tools

Since you're going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your Ubuntu installation on your Windows installation, you're going to have to type that you want to access it over and over, which means extra typing. To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to always add the extra commands for you.

This assumes you're still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your Ubuntu installation uses, please follow that shell's directions for adding an alias to its startup file.

Make sure you're in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing `cd` and hitting enter. Use `ls` to find out if you have a `.bashrc` file. Type `ls .bashrc`. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it tells you that there is no file named that, then type `ls .profile`. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then use the file name `.bashrc` in the following section.

Now that you know which profile file to use, type `code «profile file name»` where "profile file name" is the name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you've already added aliases, in that section), type the following.

    alias psql="psql -h localhost"

When you run `psql` from the command line, it will now always add the part about wanting to connect to _localhost_ every time. You would have to type that each time, otherwise.

To make sure that you set that up correctly, type `psql -U postgres postgres`. This tells the `psql` client that you want to connect as the user "postgres" (`-U postgres`) to the database postgres (`postgres` at the end), which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password that you used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly and you type the correct password, then you should see something like the following output.

    psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=#

Type `\q` and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.

Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don't have to specify it all the time. Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL will use to automatically send your password every time.

Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password that you want to use for your user. **Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the password that you want.** It _has_ to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn't like it when it's not.

    psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER"

It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created when you installed PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you should see "CREATE ROLE".

Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into your Ubuntu shell to open Visual Studio Code and create a new file.

    code ~/.pgpass

In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for port 5432 (where PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (\*), **use your Ubuntu user name and the password that you just created for that user with the `psql` command you just typed.** (If you have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type `whoami` on the command line.) Your entry in the file should have this format.

    localhost:5432:*:«your Ubuntu user name»:«the password you just used»

For the curriculum writers' systems, it looks like this in Visual Studio Code.

![pgpass file](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/windows-pgpass-configuration.png)

Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual Studio Code.

The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so that it is only readable by your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just anyone can read and write to it. This is for _your_ security. Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did this once upon a time. Here's the command.

    chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass

You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing `ls -al ~/.pgpass`. That should return output that looks like this, **with your Ubuntu user name instead of "appacademy".**

    -rw------- 1 appacademy appacademy 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/appacademy/.pgpass

Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing `psql postgres`. Because you added the alias to your startup script, and because you created your **.pgpass** file, it should now connect without prompting you for any credentials! Type `\q` and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL command line client.

## Installing Postbird

Head over to the [Postbird releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/releases). Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it's the only file in the list that ends with ".exe".

![Download Postbird](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/download-postbird.png)

After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from Windows that this is from an unidentified developer. If you don't want to install this, find a PostgreSQL GUI client that you do trust and install it or do everything from the command line.

![Postbird installation warning](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postbird-installation-warning.png)

You should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications aren't signed with the Microsoft Store for monetary and philosophical reasons.

Otherwise, if you trust Paxa like App Academy and tens of thousands of other developers do, then click the link that reads "More info" and the "Run anyway" button.

![Postbird run anyway](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postbird-installation-run-anyway.png)

When it's done installing, it will launch itself. Test it out by typing the "postgres" into the "Username" field and the password from your installation in the "Password" field. Click the Connect button. It should properly connect to the running

You can close it for now. It also installed an icon on your desktop. You can launch it from there or your Start Menu at any time.

## What you did

You installed and configured PosgreSQL 12, a relational database management system, and tools to use it! Well done!

Did you find this lesson helpful?

### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/regex-cheatsheet.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/regex-cheatsheet.md)

## Basic definitions

- String `s` *matches* the regex pattern `/p/` whenever `s` contains the pattern 'p'.
    - Example: `abc` matches `/a/`, `/b/`, `/c/`
- For simplicity, we will use the *matches* verb loosely in a sense that
    - a string can *match* a regex (e.g. 'a' matches /a/)
    - a regex can *match* a string (e.g. /a/ matches 'a')
- A regex pattern consists of *literal characters* that match itself, and *metasyntax characters* 
- Literal characters can be *concatenated* in a regular expression. String `s` matches `/ab/` if there is an `a` character *directly followed by a `b` character.
    - Example: `abc` matches `/ab/`, `/bc/`, `/abc/`
    - Example: `abc` does not match `/ac/`, `/cd/`, `/abcd/`
- *Alternative execution* can be achieved with the metasyntax character `|`
    - `/a|b/` means: match either `a` or `b`
    - Example: 'ac', 'b', 'ab' match `/a|b/`
    - Example: 'c' does not match `/a|b/`
- Iteration is achieved using repeat modifiers. One repeat modifier is the `*` (asterisk) metasyntax character. 
    - Example: `/a*/` matches any string containing any number of `a` characters
    - Example: `/a*/` matches any string, including `''`, because they all contain at least zero `a` characters
- Matching is *greedy*. A *greedy* match attempts to stay in iterations as long as possible. 
    - Example: `s = 'baaa'` matches `/a*a/` in the following way:
        - `s[0]`: `'b'` is discarded
        - `s[1]`: `'a'` matches the pattern `a*`
        - `s[1] - s[2]`: `'aa'` matches the pattern `a*`
        - `s[1] - s[3]`: `'aaa'` matches the pattern `a*`
        - as there are no more characters in `s` and there is a character yet to be matched in the regex, we *backtrack* one character
        - `s[1] - s[2]`: `'aa'` matches the pattern `a*`, and we end investigating the `a*` pattern
        - `s[3]`: `'a'` matches the `a` pattern
        - there is a complete match, `s[1] - s[2]` match the `a*` pattern, and `s[3]` matches the `a` pattern. The returned match is `aaa` starting at index `1` of string `s`
- Backtracking is *minimal*. We attempt to backtrack one character at a time in the string, and attempt to interpret the rest of the regex pattern on the remainder of the string.


## Constructing a regex

* literal form: `/regex/`
* constructor: `new RegExp( 'regex' );`
    - escaping: `/\d/` becomes `new RegExp( '\\d' )`
    - argument list: `new RegExp( pattern, modifiers );`

Applying modifiers in literal form: 
```
const regex1 = new RegExp( 'regex', 'ig' );
const regex2 = /regex/ig;
```

* `RegExp` constructor also accepts a regular expression:

```
> new RegExp( /regex/, 'i' );
/regex/i
```

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `i`      | non-case sensitive matching. Upper and lower cases don't matter.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `g`      | global match. We attempt to find all matches instead of just returning the first match. The internal state of the regular expression stores where the last match was located, and matching is resumed where it was left in the previous match. |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `m`      | multiline match. It treats the `^` and `$` characters to match the beginning and the end of each line of the tested string. A newline character is determined by `\n` or `\r`.                                                                 |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `u`      | unicode search. The regex pattern is treated as a unicode sequence                                                                                                                                                                             |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `y`      | Sticky search                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Example:

```
> const str = 'Regular Expressions';

> /re/.test( str );
false
> /re/i.test( str ); // matches: 're', 'Re', 'rE', 'RE'
true
```  

## Regex API

- `regex.exec( str )`: returns information on the first match. Exec allows iteration on the regex for all matches if the `g` modifier is set for the regex
- `regex.test( str )`: true iff regex *matches* a string

```
> const regex = /ab/;
> const str = 'bbababb';
> const noMatchStr = 'c';

> regex.exec( str ); // first match is at index 2
[ 0: "ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb" ]
> regex.exec( noMatchStr );
null

> regex.test( str );
true
> regex.test( noMatchStr );
false

> regex.exec( noMatchStr );

> const globalRegex = /ab/g;
> globalRegex.exec( str );
> globalRegex.exec( str );
[ 0: "ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb" ]
> globalRegex.exec( str );
[ 0: "ab", index: 4, input: "bbababb" ]
> globalRegex.exec( str );
null

> let result;
> while ( ( result = globalRegex.exec( str ) ) !== null ) {
      console.log( result );
  }
[ 0: "ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb" ]
[ 0: "ab", index: 4, input: "bbababb" ]  
```

## String API

- `str.match( regex )`: for non-global regular expression arguments, it returns the same return value as `regex.exec( str )`. For global regular expressions, the return value is an array containing all the matches. Returns `null` if no match has been found.
- `str.replace( regex, newString )`: replaces the first full match with `newString`. If `regex` has a global modifier, `str.replace( regex, newString )` replaces all matches with `newString`. Does not mutate the original string `str`.
- `str.search( regex )`: returns the index of the first match. Returns `-1` when no match is found. Does not consider the global modifier.
- `str.split( regex )`: does not consider the global modifier. Returns an array of strings containing strings in-between matches.

```
> const regex = /ab/;
> const str = 'bbababb';
> const noMatchStr = 'c';

> str.match( regex );
["ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb"]

> str.match( globalRegex );
["ab", "ab"]

> noMatchStr.match( globalRegex );
null

> str.replace( regex, 'X' );
"bbXabb"

> str.replace( globalRegex, 'X' )
"bbXXb"

> str.search( regex );
2

> noMatchStr.search( regex );
-1

> str.split( regex );
["bb", "", "b"]

> noMatchStr.split( regex );
["c"]
```

## Literal characters

A regex *literal character* matches itself. The expression `/a/` matches any string that contains the `a` character. Example:

```
/a/.test( 'Andrea' )   // true, because the last character is 'a'
/a/.test( 'André' )    // false, because there is no 'a' in the string
/a/i.test( 'André')    // true, because 'A' matches /a/i with the case-insensitive flag `i` applied on `/a/`
```

Literal characters are: all characters except metasyntax characters such as: `.`, `*`, `^`, `$`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `|`, `?`, `+`, `\`

When you need a metasyntax character, place a backslash in front of it. Examples: `\.`, `\\`, `\[`.

Whitespaces:
- behave as literal characters, exact match is required
- use character classes for more flexibility, such as:
    - `\n` for a newline
    - `\t` for a tab
    - `\b` for word boundaries

| `\0`                 | NULL character. Equivalent to `\x00` and `\u0000`. When the `u` flag is set for the regex, it is equivalent to `\u{0000}`.                                                                                       |

| `\1`, `\2`, ...      | backreference. `\i` is a reference to the matched contents of the *i*th capture group.                                                                                                                           |



Examples:

```
/.../.test( 'ab' )  // false, we need at least three arbitrary characters
/.a*/.test( 'a' )   // true, . matches 'a', and a* matches ''
/^a/.test( 'ba' )   // false, 'ba' does not start with a
/^a/.test( 'ab' )   // true, 'ab' starts with a
/a$/.test( 'ba' )   // true, 'ba' ends with a
/a$/.test( 'ab' )   // false, 'ab' does not end with a
/^a$/.test( 'ab' )  // false, 'ab' does not fully match a
/^a*$/.test( 'aa' ) // true, 'aa' fully matches a pattern consisting of
                    // a characters only
/[ab]/.test( 'b' )  // true, 'b' contains a character that is a
                    // member of the character class `[ab]`
/a|b/.test( 'b' )   // true, 'b' contains a character that is 
                    // either `a` or `b`
/ba?b/.test( 'bb' ) // true, the optional a is not included
/ba?b/.test( 'bab') // true, the optional a is included
/ba?b/.test( 'bcb') // false, only matches 'bb' or 'bab'
/a+/.test( '' )     // false, at least one `a` character is needed
/a+/.test( 'ba' )   // true, the `a` character was found
/a{3}/.test('baaab')// true, three consecutive 'a' characters were found  
/(a|b)c/.test('abc')// true, a `b` character is followed by `c`
/a(?=b)/.test('ab') // true. It matches 'a', because 'a' is followed by 'b'
/a(?!b)/.test('ab') // false, because 'a' is not followed by 'b'
/\ba/.test('bab')   // false, because 'a' is not the first character of a word
/\Ba/.test('bab')   // true, because 'a' is not the first character of a word
/(\d)\1/.test('55') // true. It matches two consecutive digits with the same value
```

In the last example, notice the parentheses. As the `|` operator has the lowest precedence out of all operators, parentheses made it possible to increase the prcedence of the alternative execution `a|b` higher than concatenation `(a|b)c`.

## Character sets, character classes

- `[abc]` is `a|b|c`
- `[a-c]` is `[abc]`
- `[0-9a-fA-F]` is a case-insensitive hexadecimal digit
- `[^abc]` is an arbitrary character that is not `a`, not `b`, and not `c`
- `.`: arbitrary character class
    - Example: `/..e/`: three character sequence ending with `e`
- other character classes such as digit (`\d`), not a digit (`\D`), word (`\w`), not a word (`\W`), whitespace character (`\s`): check out the section on metasyntax characters

## Basic (greedy) Repeat modifiers

Matching is maximal. Backtracking is minimal, goes character by character. 

| Repeat modifier | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`             | Match at least once                                 |
|                 |                                                     |
| `?`             | Match at most once                                  |
|                 |                                                     |
| `*`             | Match any number of times                           |
|                 |                                                     |
| `{min,max}`     | match at least `min` times, and at most `max` times |
|                 |                                                     |
| `{n}`           | Match exactly `n` times                             |

Examples:

- `/^a+$/` matches any string consisting of one or more `'a'` characters and nothing else
- `/^a?$/` matches `''` or `'a'`. The string may contain at most one `'a'` character
- `/^a*$/` matches the empty string and everything matched by `/^a+$/`
- `/^a{3,5}$/` matches `'aaa'`, `'aaaa'`, and `'aaaaa'`
- `/(ab){3}/` matches any string containing the substring `'ababab'`

## Lazy Repeat Modifiers

Matching is minimal. During backtracking, we add one character at a time.

| Repeat modifier (PCRE) | Description                                         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `+?`                   | Match at least once                                 |
|                        |                                                     |
| `??`                   | Match at most once                                  |
|                        |                                                     |
| `*?`                   | Match any number of times                           |
|                        |                                                     |
| `{min,max}?`           | match at least `min` times, and at most `max` times |
|                        |                                                     |
| `{n}?`                 | Match exactly `n` times                             |

Examples for lazy matching:

- `/^a+?$/` lazily matches any string consisting of one or more `'a'` characters and nothing else
- `/^a??$/` lazily matches `''` or `'a'`. The string may contain at most one `'a'` character
- `/^a*?$/` lazily matches the empty string and everything matched by `/^a+$/`
- `/^a{3,5}?$/` lazily matches `'aaa'`, `'aaaa'`, and `'aaaaa'`
- `/(ab){3}?/` lazily matches any string containing the substring `'ababab'`

## Capture groups

- `(` and `)` captures a substring inside a regex
- Capture groups have a reference number equal to the order of the starting parentheses of the open parentheses of the capture group starting with `1`
- `(?:` and `)` act as non-capturing parentheses, they are not included in the capture group numbering

Example:

```
/a(b|c(d|(e))(f))$/
  ^   ^  ^   ^
  |   |  |   |
  1   2  3   4
```

```
> console.table( /^a(b|c(d|(e))(f+))$/.exec( 'ab' ) )  
(index) Value
0       "ab"
1       "b"
2       undefined
3       undefined
4       undefined
index   0
input   "ab"

> console.table( /^a(b|c(d|(e))(f+))$/.exec( 'aceff' ) )  
(index) Value
0       "aceff"
1       "ceff"
2       "e"
3       "e"
4       "ff"
index   0
input   "aceff"

> console.table( /^a(b|c(?:d|(e))(f+))$/.exec( 'aceff' ) )  
(index) Value
0       "aceff"
1       "ceff"
2       "e"
3       "ff"
index   0
input   "aceff"
```

## Lookahead and Lookbehind

| Lookahead type       | JavaScript syntax | Remark                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| positive lookahead   | `(?=pattern)`     |                                       |
| negative lookahead   | `(?!pattern)`     |                                       |
| positive lookbehind  | `(?<=pattern)`    | only expected in ES2018               |
| negative lookbehind  | `(?<!pattern)`    | only expected in ES2018               |
| word boundary        | `\b`              | used both as lookahead and lookbehind |
| start of string/line | `^`               | used as a lookbehind                  |
| end of string/line   | `$`               | used as a lookbehind                  |

- Lookaheads and lookbehinds are non-capturing
- Opposed to Perl 5, lookbehinds can be of variable length, because matching is implemented backwards. This means no restrictions in lookbehind length
    - as a consequence of backwards matching, using capture groups inside lookbehinds are evaluated according to the rules of backwards matching

Examples:

```
> /a(?=b)/.exec( 'ab' )
["a", index: 0, input: "ab"]

> /a(?!\d)/.exec( 'ab' )
["a", index: 0, input: "ab"]
> /a(?!\d)/.exec( 'a0' )
null

> /(?<=a)b/.exec( 'ab' )
["b", index: 1, input: "ab"] // executed in latest Google Chrome

/(?<!a)b/.exec( 'Ab' )
["b", index: 1, input: "Ab"] // executed in latest Google Chrome

/\bregex\b/.exec( 'This regex expression tests word boundaries.' )
["regex", index: 5, input: "This regex expression tests word boundaries."]

/^regex$/.exec( 'This\nregex\nexpression\ntests\nanchors.' )
null

/^regex$/m.exec( 'This\nregex\nexpression\ntests\nanchors.' )
["regex", index: 5, input: "This↵regex↵expression↵tests↵anchors."]
```

## Possessive Repeat Modifiers

Attempts a maximal (greedy) match first. The loop does not backtrack though. It either accepts the maximal match, or fails.

Possessive repeat modifiers don't exist in JavaScript. However, there are workarounds.

Assuming we don't have any other capture groups in front of the expression, use 
- `(?=(a+))\1` instead of the generic PCRE pattern `a++` 
- `(?=(a*))\1` instead of the generic PCRE pattern `a*+`
- etc.


### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/regex-quick-sheet.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/regex-quick-sheet.md)

Let regex;

/* shorthand character classes */
regex = /d/; // matches any digit, short for [0-9]
regex = /D/; // matches non-digits, short for [^0-9]
regex = /S/; // matches non-white space character
regex = /s/; // matches any white space character
regex = /w/; // matches character, short for [a-zA-Z_0-9]
regex = /W/; // matches non-word character [^w]
regex = /b/; // Matches a word boundary where a word character is [a-zA-Z0-9_]
These meta characters boast a pre-defined meaning and make various typical patterns easier to use.

/* matching using quantifiers */
regex= /X./; // matches any character
regex= /X*/; // Matches zero or several repetitions of letter X, is short for {0,}
regex= /X+-/; // matches one or more repetitions of letter X, is short for {1,}
regex= /X?/; // finds no or exactly one letter X, is short for is short for {0,1}.
regex= // d{3}; // matches three digits. {} describes the order of the preceding liberal
regex= // d{1,4} ; // means d must occur at least once and at a maximum of four
A quantifies helps developers to define how often an element occurs.

/* character ranges */
regex = /[a-z]/; // matches all lowercase letters
regex = /[A-Z]/; // matches all uppercase letters
regex = /[e-l]/; // matches lowercase letters e to l (inclusive)
regex = /[F-P]/; // matches all uppercase letters F to P (inclusive)
regex = /[0-9]/; // matches all digits
regex = /[5-9]/; // matches any digit from 5 to 9 (inclusive)
regex = / [a-d1-7]/; // matches a letter between a and d and figures from 1 to 7, but not d1
regex = /[a-zA-Z]/; // matches all lowercase and uppercase letters
regex = /[^a-zA-Z]/; // matches non-letters

/* matching using anchors */
regex = / ^The/; // matches any string that starts with "The"
regex = / end$/; // matches a string that ends with end
regex = / ^The end$/; // exact string match starting with "The" and ending with "End"

/* escape characters */
regex = / a/; // match a bell or alarm
regex = / e/; // matches an escape
regex = / f/; // matches a form feed
regex = / n/; // matches a new line
regex = / Q…E/; // ingnores any special meanings in what is being matched
regex = / r/; // matches a carriage return
regex = / v/; // matches a vertical tab
It is critical to note that escape characters are case sensitive

/* matching using flags */
regex = / i/; // ignores the case in pattern ( upper and lower case allowed)
regex = / m/; // multi-line match
regex = / s/; // match new lines
regex = / x/; // allow spaces and comments
regex = / j/; // duplicate group names allowed
regex = / U/; // ungreedy match
Besides the regular expressions, flags can also be used to help developers with pattern matching.

/* matching a specific string */
regex = /sing/; // looks for the string between the forward slashes 9case-sensitive)… matches "sing", "sing123"
regex = /sing/i; // looks for the string between the forward slashes (case-insensitive)... matches "sing", "SinNG", "123SinNG"
regex = /hello/g; // looks for multiple occurrences of string between the forward slashes...

/* groups */
regex = /it is (sizzling )?hot outside/; // matches "it is sizzling hot outside" and "it is hot outside"
regex = /it is (?:sizzling )?hot outside/; // same as above except it is a non-capturing group
regex = /do (dogs) like pizza 1/; // matches "do dogs like pizza dogs"
regex = /do (dogs) like (pizza)? do 2 1 like you?/; // matches "do dogs like pizza? do pizza dogs like you?"

/* look-ahead and look-behind */
regex = /d(?=r)/; // matches 'd' only if it is followed by 'r', but 'r' will not be part of the overall regex match
regex = / (?<=r)d /; // matches 'd' only if it is proceeded by an 'r', but 'r' will not be part of the overall regex match

## Git

Git comes with Ubuntu, so there's nothing to install. However, you should configure it using the following instructions.

1.  Open an Ubuntu terminal if you don't have one open already.
2.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` with replacing "Your Name" with your real name.
3.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.email your@email.com` with replacing "your@email.com" with your real email.

## Google Chrome

Test if you have Chrome installed by typing "Chrome" in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads "Type here to search". If you see a search result that reads "Chrome" with "App" under it, then you have it installed. Otherwise, follow these instructions to install Google Chrome.

1.  Open Microsoft Edge, the blue "e" in the task bar, and type in [http://chrome.google.com](http://chrome.google.com/). Click the "Download Chrome" button. Click the "Accept and Install" button after reading the terms of service. Click "Save" in the "What do you want to do with ChromeSetup.exe" dialog at the bottom of the window. When you have the option to "Run" it, do so. Answer the questions as you'd like. Set it as the default browser.
2.  Right-click on the Chrome icon in the task bar and choose "Pin to taskbar".

## Node.js

Test if you have Node.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `node --version`. If it reports "Command 'node' not found", then you need to follow these directions.

1.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt update` and press Enter
2.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt install build-essential` and press Enter
3.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash` and press Enter
4.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `. ./.bashrc` and press Enter
5.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `nvm install --lts` and press Enter
6.  Confirm that **node** is installed by typing `node --version` and seeing it print something that is not "Command not found"!

## Unzip

For your projects you will often have to download a zip file and unzip it. It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux unzip utility.

In the Ubuntu terminal type: `sudo apt install unzip` and press Enter

## Mocha.js

Test if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `which mocha`. If it prints a path, then you're good. Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing `npm install -g mocha`.

## Python 3

Ubuntu does not come with Python 3. Install it using the command `sudo apt install python3`. Test it by typing `python3 --version` and seeing it print a number.

## _Note about WSL_

As of the time of writing of this document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you **close** Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal.

## Preparing your machine

The commands you need to enter are listed below. Here we will install basic developer tools, such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a 3rd party package manager for MacOS), [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) (a library of developer tools provided by Apple), VS Code (a full-featured text-editor), and Node (a JavaScript runtime environment).

### Chrome

Here at App Academy, our browser of choice is Google Chrome. This isn't super important at the beginning of the course, but once we get into frontend development (writing code that runs in a web browser) the Chrome DevTools will be crucial for debugging every manner of issue.

To install Google Chrome, download the necessary files and follow the instructions on the [Google Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

### Xcode

Let's start with Xcode. The Xcode command line tools are a requirement for installing the homebrew package manager in the next step.

**NOTE: If you are using a Linux machine you will not be able to install Xcode or homebrew.**

Install the Xcode command line tools by running the following from the console.

    $ xcode-select --install

To conclude the installation you will need to agree to the Xcode license. Start the Xcode app, click "Agree", and allow the installation to finish. Then you can go ahead and quit the Xcode app.

### Homebrew

Homebrew is kind of like a low-tech App Store. It allows us access to and the ability to install a wide variety of software and command line tools from the console. These are distinct from those hosted on the App Store and will need to be managed by Homebrew.

Enter the following in your terminal to download and install Homebrew:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You will be given a list of dependencies that will be installed and prompted to continue or abort. Press `RETURN` to continue.

Let's break this command down a bit. `curl`, a command-line tool commonly used for downloading files from the internet, is used to download the Homebrew installation file. The `"$(...)"` transforms the file content into a string. Finally, the string is passed to a Ruby language executable (`/usr/bin/ruby` is where the system Ruby executable file is stored on our machine) with the `-e` flag to tell Ruby to run the argument as code.

Check out the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) to learn the basic commands.

### Node.js & NPM

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a very powerful runtime environment built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites, robots, and other general purpose applications. For our purposes Node provides a way for us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

We want to use a version manager with Node to help us manage potential conflicts between versions and dependencies. In this case we will be using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to install/manage Node.js.

Open up your console (the Terminal application on Mac) and run the following:

    # download and run the official install script
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash

    # update your terminal config (you will now have access to the nvm command)
    source ~/.bashrc

    # install a stable version of node
    nvm install 10.16

    # set version 10.16.0 as default version
    nvm use 10.16

    # verify install/config
    which node # => /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v10.16.0/bin/node

Node comes with a package manager called [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), which provides access to a whole ecosystem of libraries and tools we can use. NPM comes pre-bundled with Node, so there is no additional work for us to do. By default we don't need any additional libraries, and any additional packages we do need to use will be installed on a project-by-project basis.

### VS Code

This one is pretty easy. Go to website for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then download and install VS Code.

To verify that the shell commands were installed correctly, run `which code` in your terminal. If `code` is not a recognized command, open the VS Code editor, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS ,`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux) and type `shell command` to find the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command. Then restart the terminal. This will now allow you to easily open files in VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command followed by a file or directory.

Next, we'll want to install a few useful VS Code extensions and configure VS Code to play nice with these extensions. Download [this zip file](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/js-local/setup-vs-code.zip), which contains a script that will do the work for you. Unzip the file and navigate into the directory where the file is located in the terminal (drag and drop the folder over to the terminal icon on macOS or right click in the directory and select `Open in Terminal` on most Linux distributions).

To run the script, run the command:

    ./setup-vs-code.sh

The script will do the rest. Now restart VS Code and you'll be good to go.

### Mocha testing framework

The last thing we'll be installing will be Mocha. Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that we will be using to test our work in the future. Here are the instructions of how to install `mocha`!

#### Installing Mocha

1.  Open Terminal
2.  Enter this command: `npm install -g mocha`
3.  To test your installation, run the command: `mocha --version`. If it returns a version number, you've successfully installed mocha! Otherwise, let your instructor know and they'll help you fix things.

### Installing Python3

You can just use _homebrew_ for this install, too.

    brew install python


### [_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/webpack-setup.md](_CONTAINER/_MARKDOWN/webpack-setup.md)



## `.gitignore`

Before discussing how to configure webpack, be aware that running webpack and using npm creates many redundant, large files in your local project directory. To avoid this use a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory to prevent these files from being pushed to and pulled from your remote Git repositories. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory and list the files or directories you want to ignore, one per line. Use a trailing `/` to indicate a directory to ignore. To re-fetch the NPM modules, we can run `npm install`, which fetches all the modules specified in `package.json`. Then run `webpack` to regenerate the `bundle.js` and `bundle.js.map` files.

For example:

    # .gitignore

    node_modules/
    bundle.js
    bundle.js.map

You can view a full collection of useful `.gitignore` templates [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Configuring Webpack

Just like with NPM, you can use a configuration file to set up your webpack options. You'll have to create this file by hand. It should live in your project's root directory, be named `webpack.config.js`, and export a single object.

### Specifying Entry and Output Files

`webpack.config.js` allows you to specify your entry file, and the name and location of your output file. See the example below:

    // webpack.config.js
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: "./frontend/my_app.jsx",
      output: {
          path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'app', 'assets', 'javascripts'),
          filename: "bundle.js"
      }
      ...
    };

**NB**: For Rails projects, make sure to locate your `bundle.js` file in `app/assets/javascripts` so that it's included in the Rails asset pipeline.

### Dev Tools / Source Map

`webpack.config.js` accepts a `devtool` key that can be used to enable useful tools, particularly `source-map`. A source map makes it possible for you to see the line numbers of your original source code when errors are raised. This is generally not possible because your `bundle.js` does not maintain the line numbers from the files it is bundling.

    // webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
      ...
      devtool: 'source-map',
      ...
    }

### Resolving Extensions

`webpack.config.js` also accepts a `resolve` key, which lets you specify what file extensions to process without explicitly naming them.

    // webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
      ...
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '*']
      },
      ...
    };

You must include the star matcher `'*'` to be able to include files with an explicit extension. Otherwise `require('file_name.js')` will cause webpack to look for `file_name.js.js`.

    // webpack.config.js
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: './frontend/entry.jsx',
      output: {
        filename: './bundle.js',
      },
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: [/\.jsx?$/],
            exclude: /(node_modules)/,
            use: {
              loader: 'babel-loader',
              query: {
                presets: ['@babel/env', '@babel/react']
              }
            },
          }
        ]
      },
      devtool: 'source-map',
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '*']
      }
    };

# Setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux for Development

*You must be running Windows 10 to perform this procedure.* If you are using a different operating system, check [When should I set up a local environment](https://help.learn.co/en/articles/1394611-when-should-i-set-up-a-local-environment) to find out what setup instructions you should follow.

*Note: It is no longer necessary to enable developer mode for Windows Subsystem Linux to work.*  

## Getting Windows Ready

1) Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) is **not** automatically enabled on windows. So, to start off, we need to enable it!

    a. Go to your Windows Search bar and type in `turn windows features on or off`  

    b.  Click on the result that matches your query. It will be in your Control Panel.  You should see something like this:

   ![toggle windows features](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/turn-windows-features-on-or-off.png)

   c. Scroll down until you see "Windows Subsystem for Linux" - ensure its box
   is checked!

   ![wsl checkbox](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-turnon.png)  

   d. Scroll up a bit until you see "Virtual Machine Platform." Turn this
   feature on as well.

   ![virtual machine platform checkbox](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-virtual-machine-platform.png)  

   > **Note:** The "Virtual Machine Platform" was added in a February 2020
   > update to Windows. If your computer has not received this update, this
   > feature may not be available. In this case, just make sure "Windows
   > Subsystem for Linux" is enabled and continue on. Keep in mind that if you
   > update, you may need to go back and enable this feature.

2)  **Restart your computer**

3)  Check your Windows 10 version by going to `System Information` and checking your Version. If your build is earlier than 16215, skip step 4 and proceed to step 5.  

   ![windows version](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/windows-version.png)

4)  Open up Microsoft Store. Search for "Ubuntu"
    1) Choose "Ubuntu" (not 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS)  


![ubuntu choice in microsoft store](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/ubuntu-choice.png)    

5) If you run into errors or if you have an early version of Windows 10, see further information  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)  

6) Open up the Ubuntu app. Follow the prompts, which will include making a username and password. Don't forget your password!  

   ![open ubuntu](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/open-ubuntu.png)  


Note: if you get an error at this step, see FAQ below.

## Start Outfitting your new Linux Subsystem: RVM / Ruby, learn-co, git, NodeJS, and Rails

7) Once everything is set up, we can start setting up our system! Start off by running the following to download our dependencies:


  ```
  sudo apt-get update  
  ```

  ```
  sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev libpq-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison gnupg postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```

8) Install RVM by running:

  ```
  gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  ```

  > __Note:__ There are two possible errors you may see at this point. Follow the appropriate instructions below:

  > **(A) If** the previous command does not work the first time (with the error `keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr` and/or `IPC connect call failed`, try running it again.
  >  If the second time works, you should see public keys imported by Piotr Kuczynski and Michal Papis. You can now continue with the procedure and disregard the rest of the instructions in this shaded area.
  >  If the command still does not work (you still get the same errors as the first attempt), then perform the following:
  >
  > ```
  > sudo apt-get install gnupg2 -y
  > gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  > ```
  >
  > **(B) If** the original error you get is `[gpg] keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure`, run the following command (following the instructions above if you get the error above):
  > ```
  > gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net:80 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  > ```

  Once you have successfully run either the `gpg` or the `gpg2` command above, run the following:

  ```
  \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
  ```
  
  When RVM finishes installing, close out of Ubuntu entirely and reopen it to make sure RVM is running.

9)  Next, to set up a ruby version most compatible with Learn.co labs, we want to download ruby 2.6.1 and set it as our default:

  ```
  rvm install 2.6.1
  rvm use 2.6.1 --default
  ```

10)  Let's install the bundler gem:  

  ```
  gem install bundler
  ```

11) And set up git:

  ```
  git config --global color.ui true
  ```

  For the next few commands, make sure to input your specific information:

  ```
  git config --global user.name "your_name"
  ```

  ```
  git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  You can either communicate with your remote repositories via HTTPS or SSH. If you want to use SSH (which means you will not have to authenticate with your GitHub username and password before each push) - [follow these instructions.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

12) Now we can get set up with the learn-co gem. This will allow you to use commands like `learn`, `learn submit`, and `learn open`.

  ```
  gem install learn-co
  ```
  
  - In your browser:
    - If you have connected your Github account to your Learn account, navigate to learn.co/your_github_username
    - If you have not connected your Github account: Go to [your profile](https://learn.co/account/profile) > Learn Settings > Public Profile. Click on the link under **Username**
  - At the bottom of the page, you should see text that says `OAuth Token:` followed by a token. Copy the token, and then go back to your WSL terminal
  - Type:

      ```
      learn whoami
      ```

  - Paste in your token  

  You should now be fully authenticated with learn.

13) Now let's get Node Version Manager, NodeJS, and Rails installed so we can make a bunch of stuff!

  - First, install NVM:

    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
    ```
  
  - Then, reload bash profile into current session:

    ```
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  
  - Next, install NodeJS:

    ```
    nvm install node
    ```
  
  - Now, Ruby on Rails:

    ```
    gem install rails
    ```

## Choose your programming editor: VSCode

You can use any editor you want, but I am going to be walking through setting up VSCode.

14) Download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Choose the Windows download, not the Linux download. Any required Linux downloads will be done via the Ubuntu terminal, and everything else should be downloaded for your Windows OS.

15) To configure your Ubuntu terminal to be available in VSCode:

  - open up VSCode
  - open the Command Palette via `F1` or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`p`
  - begin typing the following: `Terminal: Select Default Shell`  until you see it. Select that option.

  ![command palette](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/default-shell.png)  

   - Once you select it, a few options will pop up. You want to select WSL

  ![WSL Terminal](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-bash-selection.png)

16) Now, you can use your Ubuntu terminal in VSCode. Select "New Terminal" in the "Terminal" drop-down, or type `Ctrl`+`Shift`+` in order to use it!

17) Additional User Settings *(OPTIONAL)*:
  - You can add a few things to your User Settings to customize and improve your programming experience. Most importantly, we can make VSCode treat .erb files like .html files, allowing us to use all the same shortcuts and get the same syntax highlighting.
  - To open up user settings, again open up the Command Palette using `F1` or `Ctr`+`Shift`+`p` and type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`

  ![Preferences - settings](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/settings-json.png)
    
  - You will see a screen like this:

  ![Preferences - settings](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/user-settings.png)

  - To have your erb files treated like html, add the following to your user settings (circled above):
      
      ```
      "emmet.includeLanguages": {
          "erb": "html"
      }
      ```

  - Some optional personal preferences that I like:

      ```
      "window.zoomLevel": -1,
      "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off",
      "editor.fontSize": 11,
      "editor.fontFamily": "Hack, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
      ```
         
  - Note that for the Hack font to be usable, you have to download it. You can check it out [here](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).

18) Update your .learn-config
  - Travel to your Linux home directory by typing `cd`, you can change your .learn-config by typing:

    ```
    nano .learn-config
    ```

  - and customizing where you want the ```learn open``` command to save labs, and setting your editor to VSCode. Here's what it should look like:

    ```
    ---
    :learn_directory: "/mnt/c/users/<your username>/dev/flatiron/labs"
    :editor: code
    ```

  - You save a file you have modified in `nano` by following the directions at the bottom of the screen: click `Ctrl`+`X` and then `y` and then `Enter` to save your changes.

  - If you feel uncomfortable with these commands, check out the basic Linux commands link below in the resources.

## Important Knowledge: Basic Use

Your terminal is actually accessing an Ubuntu Virtual Machine which is running inside of your Windows OS. If you ever ```cd``` in your terminal, you will be sent to the 'user home' of your Linux VM. That is also the default location you will be in when you open your Ubuntu app. You actually want to do all of your business inside of your normal Windows file space, not your Linux VM file space. So, you will need to know how to navigate in your terminal from your Ubuntu file system to your Windows file system. This is pretty simple if you understand how the system is set up, so let's go over that quickly.

To allow you to access the functionality of a Linux machine, Windows stores the Ubuntu OS and file system inside of its own file system. You should NEVER access your Ubuntu files via your Windows machine. What you SHOULD do is save everything you are working on in your normal Windows filespace, and access that via your Ubuntu terminal. So, how do you do that? Well, from the Ubuntu's point of view, it is just a normal Linux machine, but Microsoft has made a pathway between the Linux VM and your Windows OS via the `/mnt` directory in your Ubuntu's root.

Here is a quick visual of what the first few levels of any Linux filesystem look like:  
![linux file system](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/linux_fs.png)

As you can see, the `mnt` directory is made for other filesystems, so that is where Microsoft connected your Linux to your Windows machine:

![linux file system](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/linux_fs_path.png)

So, you can get there from your starting point by typing:

```
cd /mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
```
or
```
cd ../../mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
```

Remember, put all of your stuff in your windows directories! That way, you have access to it via your Linux Terminal or your Windows OS, and your VSCode editor can open to the correct location when you use
```
code .
```
(if you are in your Linux file system, VSCode will open, but not to the right spot).

## Adding A Flatiron Customization To Your Terminal

Start out by ensuring you're back in the Linux home directory, with `cd ~` or just `cd`.

Then, make a backup for your `.bashrc`

```
mv .bashrc .bashrc.bak
```

We will want a tool for converting Windows ending to Unix endings for our new `.bashrc`

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
```

download the new `.bashrc`

```
curl -R "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enoch2k2/flatiron-wsl-bashrc/master/.bashrc" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

We'll use our converter to convert our bashrc to use the right unix endings:

```
dos2unix .bashrc
```
## Set up a directory for all of your labs

You'll notice that we set up our `.learn-config` file earlier with a path destination of `/mnt/c/users/<your_windows_username>/dev/flatiron/labs`. The `.bashrc` file we just downloaded gives us a really nice way to access that folder quickly by just typing in `labs` when we pull up our WSL terminal (or anytime you want to access that folder - it doesn't matter what directory you are currently in when you type it). In order for this to work, we need to make sure that these directories exist. To do this, begin by navigating to your `windows home` directory:

```
cd /mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
```
Now, let's make the appropriate files. Run these one at a time, and do it without copying and pasting. Remember the basic bash commands: `cd` changes directories to whatever folder you type in and `mkdir` creates a new directory which will be a subdirectory of the current directory location of your terminal.

```
mkdir dev
cd dev
mkdir flatiron
cd flatiron
mkdir labs
```
Now you have the directories you need, and you should have seen yourself navigating down your new file tree as you made each new directory and then `cd`'d into it.


Now, `learn open` should work seamlessly by adding your most current lab to the `labs` directory we just made.

Also, you should be able to run the command
```
labs
```
at any time in your terminal and you will be taken to your `labs`  directory. Give it a try!


## Phantomjs

In the Javascript section of the Flatiron curriculum, some tests require phantomjs. If you run across an error related to phantomjs, do the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential chrpath libssl-dev libxft-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libfontconfig1-dev -y
cd ~
export PHANTOM_JS="phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64"
wget https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs/releases/download/v2.1.1/$PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2
sudo tar xvjf $PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2
sudo mv $PHANTOM_JS /usr/local/share
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/share/$PHANTOM_JS/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/bin
phantomjs --version
```  


## Advanced topics: PostgreSQL setup (OPTIONAL)

**Setting up PostgreSQL allows simple production-level database integration into a Rails project. This allows easy hosting on Heroku with only a little setup.**

1) First, we want to [Download PostgreSQL for Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) - download the Interactive Installer.
2) Once everything is downloaded and installed, you can verify proper operation by typing in your terminal

  ```
  psql -p 5432 -h localhost -U postgres
  ```

  once connection is verified, you can quit by typing
  
  ```
  \q
  ```

3) There are a few ways to do the next few steps but the easiest way is to use pgAdmin. Open up pgAdmin, which is a Graphical User Interface for PostgreSQL.

![PGAdmin in start](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/pgadmin-start.png)

 - This should open up pgAdmin in your browser. Start a server by right-clicking "PostgreSQL" and selecting "Connect Server"

![PostgreSQL selection](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/start-server.png)
![PostgreSQL connect](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/connect-server.png)

 - Enter the password you defined during the download
 - Your PostgreSQL server is running, and can now be integrated into your projects.
 - You also want to set up a new user/role and password that you want to use with your rails app. Ensure you give your user/role all available permissions during setup.
    - During setup, ensure to fill out `Name` in the `General` tab, `Password` in the `Definition` tab, and enable all permissions in the `Privileges` tab.

![create user](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/pgadmin-create-user.png)  

![create user permissions](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/create-user-permissions.png)

  **EXAMPLE: CONNECTING YOUR POSTGRESQL SERVER TO YOUR RAILS APP**

  - Make sure your server is connected and roles are configured as described above.
  - Make sure you are in a suitable directory (in your Windows file system space) and create a Rails app configured to use PostgreSQL:
    ```
    rails new my-first-app --database=postgresql
    ```    

- Now, let's configure our `database.yml` file to allow our app to connect to our database. Add the following to your `config/database.yml` file under BOTH `development:` and `test:` You will need to add a user and password which will correspond to the roles we created in pgAdmin.

    ```
    host: localhost
    user: your-postgres-username
    password: your-postgres-usernames-password
    ```
- We can now test our database and rails interoperability by first setting up some architecture in our app:

    ```
    rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text
    ```
- now create and migrate a database:

    ```
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    ```

- If these fail, ensure you have added your database.yml configurations under both the development AND test sections

- Now, start a server:
    ```
    rails s
    ```
- If you navigate to `localhost:3000` you should see that we are on Rails!  
  ![on Rails](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/on-rails.png)
- Let's test our database by going to 'localhost:3000/posts'   
  ![posts](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/posts.png)
- Now just follow the crud links and try to make a post! We should be seeing our database working great with our rails app!

![database works](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/database-works.png)

- Hopefully, everything is working for you! Now you're ready to develop using WSL!

The header plays a key role in the design of a website and sets the tone for its every other aspect. Especially now in the era of triumphant minimalism, when various eye candies often get ruthlessly but fairly expelled. Sometimes there is nothing else left for the eye to catch, so the role of website header design has increased significantly.

Web designers put forth a lot of effort into designing this part of a website with creativity and productivity in mind. According to [Google](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub38315.html), it takes only 50 ms to form an opinion about a website and some opinions develop within the incredible 17 ms. Consumers' acquaintance with a brand starts here.

To learn how to design a website header that works, and what elements it should include, read on, there will be examples.

[Tea Manufacturer Website Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/6213097-Tea-Manufacturer-Website-Concept)

A **website header** is the top section of the web page. Back in the day, people understood headers as narrow strips in the top parts of the websites that contained a logo, a call to action, and contact information. But in modern design, the whole space above the fold of the homepage is considered a header.

Being the strategic part of the page that people see in the first seconds of loading a website, a header acts as a kind of invitation. It should provide basic information about a site so that users can understand what it offers in seconds.

Some designers make **separate headers** for various sections of the site. For example, you can make a large header for a homepage and leave a small strip for other pages. But keep it consistent. The header design on the inner page should be an abbreviated version of the header on the main page. This is a good website design practice.

[Architectural Platform Home](https://dribbble.com/shots/6508443-Architectural-Platform-Home-Animation)

The task of the header is to give users answers to the basic questions: what brand is represented, what goods and services are offered, how to get in touch with the company's employees, are there any current deals, and so on.

Apart from that, it also represents the quality and even identity of a website. If the header evokes a good emotional response, and the viewer feels that it has something of value, then you've passed the initial test.

The main elements of a website header usually are:

*   logo or brand identifier
*   call to action
*   text or headline
*   navigational elements
*   search.

You don't have to add all of them at once. It is necessary to find a balance between the abundance of information and its harmonious arrangement. Use only the data you need, overloading a header would not prove beneficial, however important all the links may seem.

Leaving the header too empty is not a good idea either. A user who cannot figure out your interface in a few seconds will most likely leave and not return. A bad header can push visitors away to another site with inferior content.

In minimalistic headers' designs, only the links to the major sections of the website and the company logo are presented. This technique is especially useful when designing [landing pages](https://shakuro.com/blog/whats-wrong-with-landing-pages).

[Design Freelancing Home Page](https://dribbble.com/shots/6696178-Design-Freelancing-Home-Page-Illustration)

Nothing limits your creativity when it comes to designing the header section. The heading of the site is an area that's open for a wide field of creative design decisions, which should be memorable, concise and useful.

Let's go over the main points.

There is no definite answer to the question of what size a website header image should be. Some [resources](https://fieldsgraphicdesign.com/wordpress/right-image-size-your-website/) try to provide sets of accurate figures, but today one of the most difficult aspects of website building is ensuring the effectiveness of every screen size. And even if two screens are of the same size, the resolution might be different, so the users won't see the same thing.

So don't fixate on the exact pixel concept, better follow simple rules of common sense.

The header should be of such a height that it does not interfere with the perception of content. For **informational resources**, a small header would be a great choice, whereas for **landings** the header may be larger.

In the case of voluminous headers, it's better to leave some space under the fold so that a user will have a glimpse of what's next on the page and start to scroll.

[Webdesigner Site Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/9173457-Webdesigner-Site-Concept)

Nielsen Norman Group first formulated their theory on the [F-shaped pattern of reading on the web](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/) in 2006, and it hasn't lost its relevance to this day.

A person who finds themselves on a new unfamiliar site always begins their visual journey from the upper left corner of the screen. And if they don't find expected information there, then the page will be automatically perceived as tricky and non-standard, requiring too much effort to understand.

**Logo.** Another [study](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/logo-placement-brand-recall/) conducted by the NN/g found out that users would much easier remember those brands whose logos are placed on the left in comparison to the center or the right part placement.

If you have a round-shaped logo then it's acceptable to place it in the center of the screen, though its effectiveness will still be lower compared to the ones placed on the left.

**Navigation.** Pay close attention not to over clutter this section of a website. Too many links overwhelm visitors. Sometimes a whole makeover of a website's structure might be in order to clear some space for the most important categories.

Make visitors easily understand where they are, and how to find their way further. Use hover effects to guide users as they navigate.

**Call to action.** Implement the principles of [visual hierarchy](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy) to naturally highlight a CTA.

![Examples of headers](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*SqL3XClHXUcZA7Xn?q=20)

[Street Fashion Product Page](https://dribbble.com/shots/6384178-Street-Fashion-Product-Page-Animation)

Persistent navigation bars, or in other words "sticky headers", mean that the navigation follows you around the page while you scroll. This is now a web design standard.

Make the header fixed if it doesn't violate your overall design concept. It's a good idea for both desktop and mobile designs:

*   E-commerce websites — the cart is always in front of the user.
*   Service websites — the phone number or a CTA are constantly on display.

Fixed headers improve the customer experience, keeping users oriented and giving them more control.

[Tea Manufacturer Website](https://dribbble.com/shots/6350763-Tea-Manufacturer-Website-Animation)

Before designing a header, consider the overall style of the website and its main purpose.

If it's a **promotional website** intended for the presentation of a product, the design of the header may contain links to the main sections, combined with a large hero image on the first screen since the main purpose of such a website is to effectively present the product. In the case of **e-commerce or business websites,** the situation might be different. A user needs to easily navigate, know about the latest deals, how to quickly contact the manager and where to see the orders they've already made, so in this case, the header may be more concise giving way to other categories.

There are several possible messages a header can convey:

*   urge a consumer to do something
*   work on trust-building
*   encourage a visitor to know more
*   be amusing, etc.

The choice depends on a particular website's aim.

![Beautiful header example](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*79uF3NtvUxWv8LSY?q=20)

[3D Model Store Concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/5983740-3D-Model-Store-Concept)

The picture in the header should directly convey information about the business. For example, if it represents the food delivery service, then the image might depict a neat courier with aesthetically attractive food. Generally speaking, the visitor, having seen your site, should want to buy something from you.

**High-quality photos.** Photography is a powerful tool for web designers. It can tell a story, evoke emotion and motivate your visitors to scroll further. For sites with powerfully striking images, try making a transparent header. It better displays the images, retaining the main links.

**Sliding images.** If you have several great photos representing the website's business, go ahead! Users can scroll through a set of exquisite high-resolution images.

**Illustrations.** Header images for websites have to strike the right chord and establish a personal connection. Better if an image is distinct and easily recognizable even if cut out from the website header. You can achieve it by capitalizing on today's [trend for illustrations](https://shakuro.com/blog/ui-ux-design-trends-for-2020).

[Builddie Website Homepage](https://dribbble.com/shots/7063640-Builddie-Website-Homepage-Design)

Don't focus your attention on static images only.

**Adding video** is among the most efficient website header ideas. If possible, try to add a thematic video material into a header. Many websites use it to captivate the audience while presenting their company or product in the best way possible.

Another way to make your design even more attractive, vivid, and memorable is to add **animation**. It can make really cool website headers. If you're looking for an interactive webpage that engages viewers, [the animation](https://shakuro.com/blog/grasping-meaningful-ui-animation) is a great alternative.

[Triumph Motorcycle Shop](https://dribbble.com/shots/6378483-Triumph-Motorcycle-Shop-Animation)

While designing a web header, the designer adds some call to action elements there like "log-in", "sign-in", "get in touch", etc. To attract the user's attention so that it resulted in the needed action, the button should contain an inscription understandable for the customer and be noticeable among other content.

A call to action placement in a strategically significant location is a perfect opportunity to urge users to take action right in the beginning, thus boosting your conversion rate. Some CTAs can be used for a period of time to promote special deals, others have a long-term presence.

First of all, the client perceives the names of the sections and the information provided by the company: contact details, interesting offers. Therefore, you need to choose clear, readable fonts that don't impair perception and could be comprehended at first sight.

For large homepage headers, you can use some bold typography and imaginative elements to catch users' attention, otherwise, it's best not to choose fancy fonts that can prove hard to read.

[Communication Security Web Page](https://dribbble.com/shots/5959487-Communication-Security-Web-Page)

By keeping a header well defined and neat, your visitors will feel like you don't try to burden them with your offers. A creative website header can have a very simple look.

[Meal Service Home Page](https://dribbble.com/shots/4596844-Meal-Service-Home-Page)

This is a solution increasingly used for website design. The hamburger menu is a small icon of three stripes, that displays the full menu when clicked. This technique is used by designers when they need to focus on the main screen.

From the point of site usability, this is a good option. Such a menu came from mobile design and is already familiar to users. The hamburger is suitable for promotional sites, where the main emphasis is on the high-quality presentation of the product using photos or videos. For online stores, this option might be less suitable, since it's important for the customer to have a basket, selected products, and a search field in quick access.

[Skate Store Versatility Case](https://dribbble.com/shots/5353048-Skate-Store-Versatility-Case)

The header should be correctly displayed not only on the desktop version of the website but also on the mobile one. So it has to be responsive and able to adjust well to any mobile device.

The [daily use of mobile devices](https://www.statista.com/statistics/241462/global-mobile-phone-website-traffic-share/) led to website designs that look like mobile-oriented even in their desktop incarnations. For example, the implementation of large hero images and hamburger menus has its origins in mobile design.

[Furniture Store Responsive Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/5419518-Furniture-Store-Responsive-Design-Flow)

The website is presented by its header. It's like a unique business card. Therefore, when designing a website, pay maximum attention to the header.

And one last best practice of a website header design: make regular alterations to keep your website fresh and up-to-date. Use some insights from this article.

### [_CONTAINER/656f37ec7d1a23d316c20e774c48ad9c/intro-2-ruby.md](_CONTAINER/656f37ec7d1a23d316c20e774c48ad9c/intro-2-ruby.md)
# Introduction to Ruby
## Why Learn Ruby?
* It has learned/stolen a ton from the languages that came before it. 
* It's elegant and easy to learn
* It doesn't focus on making code as short as possible, it cares about readability
* It has a huge community behind it - documentation, tutorials, etc.
* RAILS!
Ruby is a well designed object oriented language.  It is easy to read and stresses the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  Since many of the method names and the ruby syntax itself is so much like english, it is an ideal language to start with.

## Objectives
 * Ruby docs
 * Variables and assignments
  - Strings
  - Symbols
  - Fixnum, Float
 * Input and Output
 * Arrays
 * Booleans

## My First Ruby App - basic Hello World
* Everyone let's make a new folder for our ruby exercises:
	* ``mkdir ruby_exercises ``
* Make a new ruby file
	* ``subl ex1.rb``
* Add this to the file: 
	* ``puts 'hello world'``
	* ``puts 'my name is Bryan'``
* Now let's run our code.  Execute it with:
	* ``ruby ex1.rb``
* Ok great, our first program!  Let's add a comment and then run our code:
	* 	``#this code won't run!``
* Now let's do something different
	* ``puts '2 + 2'``
* Oh now!  That's not what we want.  How can we get it to evaluate the expression?
	* ``puts 2+ 2``
* So what's the difference?  When we use quotes, we are making a **string**.  It's text and isn't evaluated.

##Let's talk about numbers and math!
So let's do some more math besides just ``2 + 2``

* To play around with some math expressions, we're going to use something called **IRB**.  It allows us to execute short bits of Ruby code without saving it to a file and running it in the terminal.
* In IRB we can evaluate simple expressions:

```
puts "This is IRB!"
5
1000009 
```

So we have numbers!  We can do some operations with those numbers:

```
2+2
46-100
10*20
81/9
1/3 # notice what happens when we run this.
```

* We run into a problem!  That shouldn't be 0.  So what's going on?
* **Integers **are numbers without decimal points
* **Floating-Point Numbers** (floats) are numbers with decimal points

These expressions follow the order of operations.  So we can do something like:
``10 * (25 - 1)``

## EXERCISE TIME!
Write a program that outputs the number of minutes in a decade
``puts 60 * 24 * (365 * 10 + 2)``

## So let's go back to Strings
* Strings are basically groups of letters.  Things like:
	* `Ruby is awesome`
* As you've seen already we use `puts` to print things
* String Arithmetic.  
	*	You can sort of add 2 strings
		* `puts 'I like' + 'ice cream'`
	* We can also multiply them
		* puts "Hello World" * 100
	* Make sure we know the difference between numbers and digits:
	
		```
		puts 2 * 5
		puts '2' * 5
		puts '2 * 5'
		```
		
What if we want to print out the string "You're awesome"

``puts 'You\'re awesome'``

Ok, so what if we want to type the '\\' character like in 'Up\Down'

```
puts "up\\down"
puts "This should go on a \n new line"
```


## Booleans
Booleans can only have 2 values.  TRUE or FALSE

```
100 > 1
60 < 20
```
## VARIABLES
So far, we've learned about data types, but we can't do anything with these values. Variables allow us to store values and use them later.  Here's a really simple example.

```
puts 'you can say that again'
puts 'you can say that again'
# We can use a variable to help us out here
#Variables have 2 parts - NAME and VALUE
my_string = 'you can say that again'
puts my_string
puts my_string
```
So we're storing a value in the computer's memory for later use.  You can think of it as  my_string is pointing to 'you can say that again'

Of course variables can point to any data type.  So let's try another example:

```
score_1 = 99.5
score_2 = 80
average = (score_1 + score_2)/2
**#what happens if we do this:**

puts  "The average test score is: " + average

It doens't work, so we need string interpolation!
puts "The average test score is #{average}"
```
**String Interpolation**

When naming variables, most Ruby programmers use **snake_case**

### Code Along
We are going to make a simple app that asks for your first name and greets you:
```
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hey there, #{name}"
```

Now on your own, let's adapt it so that it asks for our middle and last name as well.


## Some More String Methods

[RUBY DOCS](http://www.ruby-doc.org/)

```
first_name = "Tim"
last_name = "Garcia"

# This is an example of String concatentation
# full name will be "Tim Garcia"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# This is an example of String interpolation
full_name = "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# Returns the length of the string
full_name.length
# Also returns the length of the string literal
"Tim Garcia".length

# Returns full name but all characters in lower case.
# This does not save any changes to full_name iteself
full_name.downcase

# This will still print "Tim Garcia"
puts full_name

# Saves the downcased value of the string to full_name. 
full_name.downcase!

# This will print "tim garcia", because of the call to downcase!
puts full_name

# String access.  full_name is once again Tim Garcia
full_name[0] = 'T'
full_name[4] = 'G'

# Will print 'a' to STDOUT.  'a' is the last character in the full_name String
puts full_name[-1] 
```

#### Exercise
Let's add on to our greeter program.  Ask the user what city and state they live in.  Output the capitalized city name and all upercase state name.  Explore the Ruby docs to find out how to capitalize only the first letter.

**Code Along**
We'll make a simple app that asks the user how old they are.  It will then tell them how many seconds they have lived.

```
puts "How old are you?"
age = gets.chomp
age = age.to_i
seconds = age * 365 * 24 * 60 *60
puts "You've been alive for #{seconds} seconds"
```


#ARRAYS
Arrays are a data structure that can hold multiple objects.  It's basically a list of values.

```
my_array = []
another_array = Array.new
array_3 = [4, 6, 3, 1]
word_array = ["I", "like", "chocolate"]
array_of_arrays = [my_array, another_array, array_3, word_array]
```
**Accessing Arrays**

```
arr = ["Ruby", "is", "awesome"]
puts arr[0]
puts arr[2]
puts arr[-1]

```

**Modifying an array**

### Modifying an Array
Arrays can be modified by assigning a value directly to an index or by adding values or removing them from the object. 

```
arr = [1,2,99]

# Array is now [1,2,3]
arr[2] = 3

# This adds a new value to the end of the array
# Array is now [1,2,3,4]
arr[3] = 4
```

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# The array will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
arr.push 8
arr.push 9

# The array will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.pop
arr.pop
arr.pop
arr.pop

# The array will now be [3, 4, 5]
arr.shift
arr.shift

# The array will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.unshift 2
arr.unshift 1
```

Arrays can also be concatenated together.  For example, if you have array ```[1,2,3]``` and ```[4,5,6,]```.  You can use concat to add [4,5,6] to the array.

```
arr = [1,2,3]
arr.concat [4,5,6]

# Prints [1,2,3,4,5,6]
puts arr.to_s
```

Keep in mind that the array will take up space from index 0 to the last index that you create.  So the code below creates a large array of values that you probably do not want:

```
arr = []
arr[9999] = 1
```

### Code Along
We're going to make a program that stores a list of students in the class and then outputs them.

```
students = []
puts "Add a name"
students.push (gets.chomp)
puts "Add a name"
students.push (gets.chomp)
puts "Add a name"
students.push (gets.chomp)
p students
```

### **Exercise**

Make an app that asks the user for 5 numbers.  Store them in an array.  At the end, output the numbers from lowest to highest.  Look in the array documentation on Ruby Docs.






### [_CONTAINER/656f37ec7d1a23d316c20e774c48ad9c/ruby2.md](_CONTAINER/656f37ec7d1a23d316c20e774c48ad9c/ruby2.md)


### Control Flow

**Objectives**
* If Statements
* Each Loops
* While Loops
* Exercises!

## Quick Review of Expressions
What's the difference?

```
x = 5
x == 5
```

Control flow uses **boolean expressions** to determine which code path to take.
Some basic control flow statements are below.

**We can make decisions!  Add logic to our code**

```
if something
  do something
end
```
So let's look a super basic example

```
puts "Hello, what's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello, #{name}"
if name == 'Colt'
  puts "What a great name! "
end
```
Now let's add **an else condition**

```
puts "Hello, what's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello, #{name}"
if name == 'Colt'
  puts "What a great name! "
else
  puts "That's a pretty good name too!"
end

```
**Open teacher.rb and have student walk me through it**

### **Elsif Statements**

```
num = 20
average = 50

if num < average
  puts "#{num} is below average"
elsif num > average
  puts  "#{num} is above average"
else
  puts  "#{num} is exactly average"
end

```
Since ruby is all about being human readable.  It also allows us to do one line control flow statements.

```
num = 10
max = 5

# Max is now 10
max = num if num > max
```
Also, since ruby is human readable, control flow statements generally have an opposite.  For if, the opposite is ```unless```

```
num = 1
min = 5

# Min is now 1
min = num unless num > min
```
Typically you use the control flow statements that sounds most natural in english.


**FIST TO FIVE**


### Exercise
Write a calculator program that takes a number, an operation +,-,/,*, then another number.  The program should be able to handle decimal numbers.  Below is sample output:

```
Enter a number, a +,-,/,*, then another number.
7
/ 
2
Result: 3.5
```

## Loops

Loops are essential to programming.  They allow us to repeat an operation many times.  Typically, execution of a loop lasts as long as a certain value holds true or as long as a set of data is being iterated over.  Below is an example of printing the values from 0 to 10 done using many different methods.  Note that 0..10 is a Range type, which was discussed earlier.




**Times do loops**

```
9.times do
  puts "HELLO"
end
```

**For Loops**

```
for i in 0..10
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
end
```

```
## Exercise: 99 bottles of beer
count = 99
while count > 0
  puts "#{count} bottles of beer on the wall"
  count = count -1
  puts "Take one down, pass it around #{count} bottles of beer on the wall"
end


```
# Iteration using a block
(0..10).each do |i|
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
end
```

```
# A more condensed way to iterate using a block.
(0..10).each { |i| puts "The value of i is now #{i}" }
```

```
# Iterating with a while loop
i = 0
num = 10

while i <= num do
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
  i += 1
end
```
## While Loops

```
command = ''

while command != 'bye'
  puts command
  command = gets.chomp
end

puts 'Come again soon!'
```

```
# Iterating until a value is true
i = 0
num = 10

until i > num
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
  i += 1
end
```

### Break
Break is a keyword that stops iteration of a loop.  In the example below, if i is equal to 6, then break is called. The output of the program will be 1 4 (each on separate lines).

```
arr = [1,4,6,9,24]
for i in arr
  break if i == 6
  puts i
end
```




***

### Exercises
#### Average
Given an array of numbers, find the average value.  You can write any array you like into your code.  Below is example output:
```
The average of [1, 4] is:
2.5
```

#### Sum
Write a program that asks the user for a number, then prints the sum of all the numbers between 0 and n incluse.  For example if the user enters 5, the program should sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.  Sample output is below:

```
Enter a number, N.  The sum of 0 to N will be printed.
2
3
```

```
Enter a number, N.  The sum of 0 to N will be printed.
5
15
```

# Appendix - Programs from Study hall
The programs below were used as in class exercises during the study hall.  They are added here for reference.

## Introduction
Write a program that introduces yourself to your neighbor.  The program should first ask your neighbor for his or her name and ask how many prework assignments they have completed.  Your program will then print the information back to the user along with a fun fact about yourself.  The output should look like this:

```
Hello, Jordan.  I'm Tim.  Nice to meet you.
I see you have completed 14 assignments.  I have completed 10 assignments"
In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee."
```
### Solution

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# Saving my friends name
puts "Hello, what is your name?"
friends_name = gets.chomp

# Saving the number of completed assignments
puts "How many prework assignments have you completed?"
completed_assignments = gets.chomp

# Putting to STDOUT
puts "Hello, #{friends_name}.  I'm Tim.  Nice to meet you"
puts "I see you have completed #{completed_assignments} assignments.  I have completed 1 assignment"
puts "In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee"
```

## Odd Or Even
Write a program that decides if a number is odd or even.

### Solution
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Please enter a number"
num = gets.to_i

if num % 2 == 0
  puts "#{num} is even"
else
  puts "#{num} is odd"
end
```

## Reverse a Word
Given a word from the user.  Reverse the word and print it back to the user.

### Solution

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Enter a string to reverse"
puts gets.chomp.reverse
```

## Calculator
Write a simple calculator program.  It should take as input, a number [enter], a + or - sign [enter], then another number.  The expressionw should then be evaluated and displayed to the user.  Below is sample input

```
Enter a number, a + or - sign, then another number
5
-
3
Result: 2
```

### Solution
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# A calculator program  that only understands addition and subtraction

puts "Enter a number, a + or - sign, then another number"

# Getting our input.  The program only supports simple 2 term expressions
num1 = gets.to_i

sign = gets.chomp

num2 = gets.to_i

if sign == "+"
  puts "Result: #{num1 + num2}"
elsif sign == "-"
  puts "Result: #{num1 - num2}"
else
  puts "Please re-read the instructions"
end
```

## Find Max
Find the maximum value in a array.

### Solution

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

arr = [1,3,9,5,34,99,20,-35,9]

max = arr[0]

arr.each do |i|
  if i > max
    max = i
  end 
end

puts "The maximum value in the array is #{max}"
```

## Palindrome
Write a program that decides if a word entered by the user is a palindrome.  A palindrome is a word that is the same when spelled forward or in reverse.  For example, wow is a palindrome.  It is the same string when reversed.

### Solution
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Enter a word.  We'll see if it's a palindrome"
word = gets.chomp

if word == word.reverse
  puts "#{word} is a palindrome"
else
  puts "#{word} is NOT a palindrome"
end
```

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/auth0/open-source-template/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please use our [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/whitehat) which is monitored by our security team.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
- If you've never contributed before, see [the first timer's guide on our blog](https://auth0.com/blog/a-first-timers-guide-to-an-open-source-project/) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.com/bgoonz/Music-Theory-n-Web-Synth-Keyboard/issues) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo or on our [docs site](https://auth0.com/docs).
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/bgoonz/Music-Theory-n-Web-Synth-Keyboard)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork

## Tools
> Awesome tools that will make your life easier.

### IDEs

| ☆ | Name | Platform | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ★★★ | [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) | CLI / Cross-Platform | Vim is one of the most popular text editors among advanced programmers. It allows text-editing to be done very efficiently with solely keystrokes. Vim is also highly configurable, extensible and integrates with shells (command lines) really well. The only setback about Vim is that it has a high learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ | [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) | CLI / Cross-Platform | Emacs is another popular text editor (or development environment to be more precise). The debate on "Vim vs. Emacs" is constantly brought up due to their popularity. Basically Emacs is more than just a text editor. It has plugins like file managers, web browsers, mail clients and news clients that allows users to performs these tasks directly inside Emacs. Emacs is "heavier" because of this, but it arguably has a relatively easier learning curve for beginners. |
| ★★★ | [Far Manager](https://www.farmanager.com/download.php?l=en) | Hybrid / Windows | Far Manager is the most widely-used editor in the RU/CIS competitive programming community. It's actually a file manager in its bare bones, but you can install [FarColorer](http://colorer.sourceforge.net/farplugin.html) - a syntax highlighter plugin to program on it. Properly configured, Far Manager allows you to navigate between files very efficiently while writing your codes. |
| ★★★ | [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/downloads) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Code::Blocks is the go-to IDE for C/C++. It's a full-fledged, versatile IDE with numerous great features. Code::Blocks is usually provided along with Vim in programming contests. |
| ★★★ | [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/#chooseYourEdition) | GUI / Cross-Platform | IntelliJ IDEA is certainly one of the best IDEs for Java. It's used by most competitive programmers who use Java as their main language. Be sure to check out [CHelper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7091-chelper), a very handy plugin written for programming contests. |
| ★★☆ | [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Sublime Text is an extraordinary text editor. Packed with powerful and innovative features like Multiple Carets, Minimaps and Command Palletes, it attracts a strong and engaging community. Sublime Text is highly extensible, so be sure to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed and explore perhaps one of the largest catalogue of plugins! |
| ★★☆ | [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Eclipse is another good IDE for Java. It's an okay alternative to Intellij IDEA (A tad inferior to IDEA by today's standards). Sometimes contests only provide Eclipse for some reason, so this might be a good incentive to try and use Eclipse. |
| ★★☆ | [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | CLion, produced by JetBrains - the same company who made Intellij IDEA, is a powerful IDE for C++. Free educational licenses are available OR you can try out their [EAP (Early Access Program)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CLION/Early+Access+Program) which is still free as of Apr, 2018. You may want to turn off its code inspection feature as it will cause quite a bit of lag. |
| ★☆☆ | Other IDEs | Mixed | [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is the IDE to use in case you want to code in C#. ... Both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are built with Electron (written in JavaScript) and therefore somewhat resource-hogging. ... [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/) is a newly rising IDE. Beware that the load-up and project-creation times can be extraordinary. | 

### Personal use

| ★★★ | [VisuAlgo](https://visualgo.net/en) | A website featuring a large collection of visualization tools for algorithms and data structures. |
| ★★★ | General Practice Helpers: ... [CHelper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7091-chelper) (IntelliJ IDEA) ([manual](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/3273)) ... [caide](https://github.com/slycelote/caide) (Visual Studio, CodeLite, standalone command line app) ... [JHelper](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/13369) (AppCode, CLion) [online-judge-tools](https://github.com/kmyk/online-judge-tools) (Stand alone CLI tool, It is actively maintained.) | Great tools that parse contests, inline library codes and provide testing frameworks. They save you from spending your precious time on switching windows and copy-pasting back and forth. |
| ★★☆ | Codeforces Parsers: ... [Codeforces Parser](https://github.com/johnathan79717/codeforces-parser) ... [GoCF](https://github.com/sukeesh/GoCF) ... [cfparser](https://github.com/gnull/cfparser) (emacs) [cfparser](https://github.com/ikatanic/cfparser) (cli) | These tools parse Codeforces contest problems and help run sample tests. |
| ★★★ | [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org/) | A stunning encyclopedia with a database of countless integer sequences. It also features a powerful search engine. Sometimes a seemingly difficult combinatorics problem could be equivalent to a simple or studied integer sequence. |
| ★★☆ | Syntax Highlighters: ... [tohtml.com](https://tohtml.com/) ... [markup.su](http://markup.su/highlighter/) ... [hilite.me](http://hilite.me/) | Very handy for creating slides or team notebooks with pretty, formatted code snippets. Just copy the highlighted code snippets and paste them in your favorite WYSIWYG (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get) editor! |
| ★★☆ | Code Sharing: ... [Ideone.com](https://ideone.com/) ... [Pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/) ... [Ubuntu Pastebin](https://paste.ubuntu.com/) | These tools generate semi-permanent pages for code sharing. Very useful especially when you're trying to get someone else to look into your code. |
| ★★☆ | [Ineffable](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/19083) | A simple command-line grader for local grading. |
| ★★☆ | [uDebug](https://www.udebug.com/) | A platform that provides expected outputs for user-specified inputs to problems on the UVa Online Judge. Some problems also provide additional test cases for debugging. |

### [_CONTAINER/7776985e0ce36d60479e76541659f649/nodeChildProcesses.md](_CONTAINER/7776985e0ce36d60479e76541659f649/nodeChildProcesses.md)
# Child process | Node.js v15.12.0 Documentation

> Source Code: lib/child_process.js

**Source Code:** [lib/child\_process.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v15.12.0/lib/child_process.js)

The `child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability is primarily provided by the [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) function:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
    
    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });

By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }` option if the output will not be consumed.

The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment variable if it is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is used.

On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing objects to the `env` option that have multiple variants of the same key, such as `PATH` and `Path`.

The [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) method spawns the child process asynchronously, without blocking the Node.js event loop. The [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options) function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.

For convenience, the `child_process` module provides a handful of synchronous and asynchronous alternatives to [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) and [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options). Each of these alternatives are implemented on top of [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) or [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options).

*   [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback): spawns a shell and runs a command within that shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when complete.
*   [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback): similar to [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) except that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by default.
*   [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options): spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows sending messages between parent and child.
*   [`child_process.execSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options): a synchronous version of [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) that will block the Node.js event loop.
*   [`child_process.execFileSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execfilesync_file_args_options): a synchronous version of [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) that will block the Node.js event loop.

For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the [synchronous counterparts](#child_process_synchronous_process_creation) may be more convenient. In many cases, however, the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.

Asynchronous process creation[#](#child_process_asynchronous_process_creation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options), [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), and [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) methods all follow the idiomatic asynchronous programming pattern typical of other Node.js APIs.

Each of the methods returns a [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) instance. These objects implement the Node.js [`EventEmitter`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) API, allowing the parent process to register listener functions that are called when certain events occur during the life cycle of the child process.

The [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) and [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) methods additionally allow for an optional `callback` function to be specified that is invoked when the child process terminates.

### Spawning `.bat` and `.cmd` files on Windows[#](#child_process_spawning_bat_and_cmd_files_on_windows)

The importance of the distinction between [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) and [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) can vary based on platform. On Unix-type operating systems (Unix, Linux, macOS) [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) can be more efficient because it does not spawn a shell by default. On Windows, however, `.bat` and `.cmd` files are not executable on their own without a terminal, and therefore cannot be launched using [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback). When running on Windows, `.bat` and `.cmd` files can be invoked using [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) with the `shell` option set, with [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), or by spawning `cmd.exe` and passing the `.bat` or `.cmd` file as an argument (which is what the `shell` option and [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) do). In any case, if the script filename contains spaces it needs to be quoted.

    
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const bat = spawn('cmd.exe', ['/c', 'my.bat']);
    
    bat.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(data.toString());
    });
    
    bat.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(data.toString());
    });
    
    bat.on('exit', (code) => {
      console.log(`Child exited with code ${code}`);
    });

    
    const { exec, spawn } = require('child_process');
    exec('my.bat', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
      }
      console.log(stdout);
    });
    
    
    const bat = spawn('"my script.cmd"', ['a', 'b'], { shell: true });
    
    exec('"my script.cmd" a b', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
      
    });

### `child_process.exec(command[, options][, callback])`[#](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback)

    *   `uid` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Sets the user identity of the process (see [`setuid(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html)).
    *   `gid` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) Sets the group identity of the process (see [`setgid(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html)).

*   Returns: [<ChildProcess>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess)

Spawns a shell then executes the `command` within that shell, buffering any generated output. The `command` string passed to the exec function is processed directly by the shell and special characters (vary based on [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters)) need to be dealt with accordingly:

    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    
    exec('"/path/to/test file/test.sh" arg1 arg2');
    
    
    
    exec('echo "The \\$HOME variable is $HOME"');
    

**Never pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

If a `callback` function is provided, it is called with the arguments `(error, stdout, stderr)`. On success, `error` will be `null`. On error, `error` will be an instance of [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error). The `error.code` property will be the exit code of the process. By convention, any exit code other than `0` indicates an error. `error.signal` will be the signal that terminated the process.

The `stdout` and `stderr` arguments passed to the callback will contain the stdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode the output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The `encoding` option can be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and stderr output. If `encoding` is `'buffer'`, or an unrecognized character encoding, `Buffer` objects will be passed to the callback instead.

    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    exec('cat *.js missing_file | wc -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
        return;
      }
      console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
      console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    });

If `timeout` is greater than `0`, the parent will send the signal identified by the `killSignal` property (the default is `'SIGTERM'`) if the child runs longer than `timeout` milliseconds.

Unlike the [`exec(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.exec()` does not replace the existing process and uses a shell to execute the command.

If this method is invoked as its [`util.promisify()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/util.html#util_util_promisify_original)ed version, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `stdout` and `stderr` properties. The returned `ChildProcess` instance is attached to the `Promise` as a `child` property. In case of an error (including any error resulting in an exit code other than 0), a rejected promise is returned, with the same `error` object given in the callback, but with two additional properties `stdout` and `stderr`.

    const util = require('util');
    const exec = util.promisify(require('child_process').exec);
    
    async function lsExample() {
      const { stdout, stderr } = await exec('ls');
      console.log('stdout:', stdout);
      console.error('stderr:', stderr);
    }
    lsExample();

If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:

    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const { signal } = controller;
    const child = exec('grep ssh', { signal }, (error) => {
      console.log(error); 
    });
    controller.abort();

*   Returns: [<ChildProcess>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess)

The `child_process.execFile()` function is similar to [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) except that it does not spawn a shell by default. Rather, the specified executable `file` is spawned directly as a new process making it slightly more efficient than [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

The same options as [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) are supported. Since a shell is not spawned, behaviors such as I/O redirection and file globbing are not supported.

    const { execFile } = require('child_process');
    const child = execFile('node', ['--version'], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        throw error;
      }
      console.log(stdout);
    });

The `stdout` and `stderr` arguments passed to the callback will contain the stdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode the output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The `encoding` option can be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and stderr output. If `encoding` is `'buffer'`, or an unrecognized character encoding, `Buffer` objects will be passed to the callback instead.

    const execFile = util.promisify(require('child_process').execFile);
    async function getVersion() {
      const { stdout } = await execFile('node', ['--version']);

    *   `silent` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If `true`, stdin, stdout, and stderr of the child will be piped to the parent, otherwise they will be inherited from the parent, see the `'pipe'` and `'inherit'` options for [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options)'s [`stdio`](#child_process_options_stdio) for more details. **Default:** `false`.

The `child_process.fork()` method is a special case of [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) used specifically to spawn new Node.js processes. Like [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), a [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object is returned. The returned [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) will have an additional communication channel built-in that allows messages to be passed back and forth between the parent and child. See [`subprocess.send()`](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) for details.

Keep in mind that spawned Node.js child processes are independent of the parent with exception of the IPC communication channel that is established between the two. Each process has its own memory, with their own V8 instances. Because of the additional resource allocations required, spawning a large number of child Node.js processes is not recommended.

By default, `child_process.fork()` will spawn new Node.js instances using the [`process.execPath`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_execpath) of the parent process. The `execPath` property in the `options` object allows for an alternative execution path to be used.

Node.js processes launched with a custom `execPath` will communicate with the parent process using the file descriptor (fd) identified using the environment variable `NODE_CHANNEL_FD` on the child process.

Unlike the [`fork(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.fork()` does not clone the current process.

The `shell` option available in [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) is not supported by `child_process.fork()` and will be ignored if set.

If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:

    if (process.argv[2] === 'child') {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`Hello from ${process.argv[2]}!`);
      }, 1_000);
    } else {
      const { fork } = require('child_process');
      const controller = new AbortController();
      const { signal } = controller;
      const child = fork(__filename, ['child'], { signal });
      child.on('error', (err) => {
        
      });
      controller.abort();

*   Returns: [<ChildProcess>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess)
    

The `child_process.spawn()` method spawns a new process using the given `command`, with command-line arguments in `args`. If omitted, `args` defaults to an empty array.

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

A third argument may be used to specify additional options, with these defaults:

    const defaults = {
      cwd: undefined,
      env: process.env
    };

Use `cwd` to specify the working directory from which the process is spawned. If not given, the default is to inherit the current working directory. If given, but the path does not exist, the child process emits an `ENOENT` error and exits immediately. `ENOENT` is also emitted when the command does not exist.

Use `env` to specify environment variables that will be visible to the new process, the default is [`process.env`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_env).

`undefined` values in `env` will be ignored.

Example of running `ls -lh /usr`, capturing `stdout`, `stderr`, and the exit code:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
    
    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });

Example: A very elaborate way to run `ps ax | grep ssh`

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ps = spawn('ps', ['ax']);
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
    
    ps.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      grep.stdin.write(data);
    });
    
    ps.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`ps stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ps.on('close', (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        console.log(`ps process exited with code ${code}`);
      }
      grep.stdin.end();
    });
    
    grep.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(data.toString());
    });
    
    grep.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`grep stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    grep.on('close', (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        console.log(`grep process exited with code ${code}`);
      }
    });

Example of checking for failed `spawn`:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const subprocess = spawn('bad_command');
    
    subprocess.on('error', (err) => {
      console.error('Failed to start subprocess.');
    });

Certain platforms (macOS, Linux) will use the value of `argv[0]` for the process title while others (Windows, SunOS) will use `command`.

Node.js currently overwrites `argv[0]` with `process.execPath` on startup, so `process.argv[0]` in a Node.js child process will not match the `argv0` parameter passed to `spawn` from the parent, retrieve it with the `process.argv0` property instead.

If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const { signal } = controller;
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh'], { signal });
    grep.on('error', (err) => {
      
    });
    controller.abort(); 

#### `options.detached`[#](#child_process_options_detached)

Added in: v0.7.10

On Windows, setting `options.detached` to `true` makes it possible for the child process to continue running after the parent exits. The child will have its own console window. Once enabled for a child process, it cannot be disabled.

On non-Windows platforms, if `options.detached` is set to `true`, the child process will be made the leader of a new process group and session. Child processes may continue running after the parent exits regardless of whether they are detached or not. See [`setsid(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html) for more information.

By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent the parent from waiting for a given `subprocess` to exit, use the `subprocess.unref()` method. Doing so will cause the parent's event loop to not include the child in its reference count, allowing the parent to exit independently of the child, unless there is an established IPC channel between the child and the parent.

When using the `detached` option to start a long-running process, the process will not stay running in the background after the parent exits unless it is provided with a `stdio` configuration that is not connected to the parent. If the parent's `stdio` is inherited, the child will remain attached to the controlling terminal.

Example of a long-running process, by detaching and also ignoring its parent `stdio` file descriptors, in order to ignore the parent's termination:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: 'ignore'
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();

Alternatively one can redirect the child process' output into files:

    const fs = require('fs');
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const out = fs.openSync('./out.log', 'a');
    const err = fs.openSync('./out.log', 'a');
    
    const subprocess = spawn('prg', [], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: [ 'ignore', out, err ]
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();

#### `options.stdio`[#](#child_process_options_stdio)

The `options.stdio` option is used to configure the pipes that are established between the parent and child process. By default, the child's stdin, stdout, and stderr are redirected to corresponding [`subprocess.stdin`](#child_process_subprocess_stdin), [`subprocess.stdout`](#child_process_subprocess_stdout), and [`subprocess.stderr`](#child_process_subprocess_stderr) streams on the [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object. This is equivalent to setting the `options.stdio` equal to `['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']`.

For convenience, `options.stdio` may be one of the following strings:

*   `'pipe'`: equivalent to `['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` (the default)
*   `'overlapped'`: equivalent to `['overlapped', 'overlapped', 'overlapped']`
*   `'ignore'`: equivalent to `['ignore', 'ignore', 'ignore']`
*   `'inherit'`: equivalent to `['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit']` or `[0, 1, 2]`

Otherwise, the value of `options.stdio` is an array where each index corresponds to an fd in the child. The fds 0, 1, and 2 correspond to stdin, stdout, and stderr, respectively. Additional fds can be specified to create additional pipes between the parent and child. The value is one of the following:

1.  `'pipe'`: Create a pipe between the child process and the parent process. The parent end of the pipe is exposed to the parent as a property on the `child_process` object as [`subprocess.stdio[fd]`](#child_process_subprocess_stdio). Pipes created for fds 0, 1, and 2 are also available as [`subprocess.stdin`](#child_process_subprocess_stdin), [`subprocess.stdout`](#child_process_subprocess_stdout) and [`subprocess.stderr`](#child_process_subprocess_stderr), respectively.
    
2.  `'overlapped'`: Same as `'pipe'` except that the `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` flag is set on the handle. This is necessary for overlapped I/O on the child process's stdio handles. See the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/synchronous-and-asynchronous-i-o) for more details. This is exactly the same as `'pipe'` on non-Windows systems.
    
3.  `'ipc'`: Create an IPC channel for passing messages/file descriptors between parent and child. A [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) may have at most one IPC stdio file descriptor. Setting this option enables the [`subprocess.send()`](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) method. If the child is a Node.js process, the presence of an IPC channel will enable [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) and [`process.disconnect()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_disconnect) methods, as well as [`'disconnect'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_disconnect) and [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) events within the child.
    
    Accessing the IPC channel fd in any way other than [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) or using the IPC channel with a child process that is not a Node.js instance is not supported.
    
4.  `'ignore'`: Instructs Node.js to ignore the fd in the child. While Node.js will always open fds 0, 1, and 2 for the processes it spawns, setting the fd to `'ignore'` will cause Node.js to open `/dev/null` and attach it to the child's fd.
    
5.  `'inherit'`: Pass through the corresponding stdio stream to/from the parent process. In the first three positions, this is equivalent to `process.stdin`, `process.stdout`, and `process.stderr`, respectively. In any other position, equivalent to `'ignore'`.
    
6.  [<Stream>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_stream) object: Share a readable or writable stream that refers to a tty, file, socket, or a pipe with the child process. The stream's underlying file descriptor is duplicated in the child process to the fd that corresponds to the index in the `stdio` array. The stream must have an underlying descriptor (file streams do not until the `'open'` event has occurred).
    
7.  Positive integer: The integer value is interpreted as a file descriptor that is currently open in the parent process. It is shared with the child process, similar to how [<Stream>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_stream) objects can be shared. Passing sockets is not supported on Windows.
    
8.  `null`, `undefined`: Use default value. For stdio fds 0, 1, and 2 (in other words, stdin, stdout, and stderr) a pipe is created. For fd 3 and up, the default is `'ignore'`.
    

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    
    spawn('prg', [], { stdio: 'inherit' });
    
    
    spawn('prg', [], { stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', process.stderr] });
    
    
    
    spawn('prg', [], { stdio: ['pipe', null, null, null, 'pipe'] });

_It is worth noting that when an IPC channel is established between the parent and child processes, and the child is a Node.js process, the child is launched with the IPC channel unreferenced (using `unref()`) until the child registers an event handler for the [`'disconnect'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_disconnect) event or the [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event. This allows the child to exit normally without the process being held open by the open IPC channel._

On Unix-like operating systems, the [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) method performs memory operations synchronously before decoupling the event loop from the child. Applications with a large memory footprint may find frequent [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) calls to be a bottleneck. For more information, see [V8 issue 7381](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=7381).

Synchronous process creation[#](#child_process_synchronous_process_creation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options), [`child_process.execSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options), and [`child_process.execFileSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execfilesync_file_args_options) methods are synchronous and will block the Node.js event loop, pausing execution of any additional code until the spawned process exits.

Blocking calls like these are mostly useful for simplifying general-purpose scripting tasks and for simplifying the loading/processing of application configuration at startup.

The `child_process.execFileSync()` method is generally identical to [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) with the exception that the method will not return until the child process has fully closed.

If the child process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal and does not exit, the parent process will still wait until the child process has exited.

If the process times out or has a non-zero exit code, this method will throw an [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error) that will include the full result of the underlying [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options).

The `child_process.spawnSync()` method is generally identical to [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) with the exception that the function will not return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been encountered and `killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process has completely exited. If the process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal and doesn't exit, the parent process will wait until the child process has exited.

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

Class: `ChildProcess`[#](#child_process_class_childprocess)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Added in: v2.2.0

*   Extends: [<EventEmitter>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)

Instances of the `ChildProcess` represent spawned child processes.

Instances of `ChildProcess` are not intended to be created directly. Rather, use the [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback), or [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options) methods to create instances of `ChildProcess`.

### Event: `'close'`[#](#child_process_event_close)

Added in: v0.7.7

*   `code` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The exit code if the child exited on its own.
*   `signal` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The signal by which the child process was terminated.

The `'close'` event is emitted when the stdio streams of a child process have been closed. This is distinct from the [`'exit'`](#child_process_event_exit) event, since multiple processes might share the same stdio streams.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
    
    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process close all stdio with code ${code}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('exit', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });

### Event: `'disconnect'`[#](#child_process_event_disconnect)

Added in: v0.7.2

The `'disconnect'` event is emitted after calling the [`subprocess.disconnect()`](#child_process_subprocess_disconnect) method in parent process or [`process.disconnect()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_disconnect) in child process. After disconnecting it is no longer possible to send or receive messages, and the [`subprocess.connected`](#child_process_subprocess_connected) property is `false`.

### Event: `'error'`[#](#child_process_event_error)

*   `err` [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) The error.

The `'error'` event is emitted whenever:

1.  The process could not be spawned, or
2.  The process could not be killed, or
3.  Sending a message to the child process failed.

The `'exit'` event may or may not fire after an error has occurred. When listening to both the `'exit'` and `'error'` events, guard against accidentally invoking handler functions multiple times.

See also [`subprocess.kill()`](#child_process_subprocess_kill_signal) and [`subprocess.send()`](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback).

### Event: `'exit'`[#](#child_process_event_exit)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   `code` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The exit code if the child exited on its own.
*   `signal` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The signal by which the child process was terminated.

The `'exit'` event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process exited, `code` is the final exit code of the process, otherwise `null`. If the process terminated due to receipt of a signal, `signal` is the string name of the signal, otherwise `null`. One of the two will always be non-`null`.

When the `'exit'` event is triggered, child process stdio streams might still be open.

Node.js establishes signal handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` and Node.js processes will not terminate immediately due to receipt of those signals. Rather, Node.js will perform a sequence of cleanup actions and then will re-raise the handled signal.

See [`waitpid(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitpid.2.html).

### Event: `'message'`[#](#child_process_event_message)

Added in: v0.5.9

*   `message` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A parsed JSON object or primitive value.
*   `sendHandle` [<Handle>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_server_listen_handle_backlog_callback) A [`net.Socket`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_class_net_socket) or [`net.Server`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_class_net_server) object, or undefined.

The `'message'` event is triggered when a child process uses [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) to send messages.

The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting message might not be the same as what is originally sent.

If the `serialization` option was set to `'advanced'` used when spawning the child process, the `message` argument can contain data that JSON is not able to represent. See [Advanced serialization](#child_process_advanced_serialization) for more details.

### Event: `'spawn'`[#](#child_process_event_spawn)

Added in: v15.1.0

The `'spawn'` event is emitted once the child process has spawned successfully.

If emitted, the `'spawn'` event comes before all other events and before any data is received via `stdout` or `stderr`.

The `'spawn'` event will fire regardless of whether an error occurs **within** the spawned process. For example, if `bash some-command` spawns successfully, the `'spawn'` event will fire, though `bash` may fail to spawn `some-command`. This caveat also applies when using `{ shell: true }`.

### `subprocess.channel`[#](#child_process_subprocess_channel)

*   [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A pipe representing the IPC channel to the child process.

The `subprocess.channel` property is a reference to the child's IPC channel. If no IPC channel currently exists, this property is `undefined`.

#### `subprocess.channel.ref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_channel_ref)

Added in: v7.1.0

This method makes the IPC channel keep the event loop of the parent process running if `.unref()` has been called before.

#### `subprocess.channel.unref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_channel_unref)

Added in: v7.1.0

This method makes the IPC channel not keep the event loop of the parent process running, and lets it finish even while the channel is open.

### `subprocess.connected`[#](#child_process_subprocess_connected)

Added in: v0.7.2

*   [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Set to `false` after `subprocess.disconnect()` is called.

The `subprocess.connected` property indicates whether it is still possible to send and receive messages from a child process. When `subprocess.connected` is `false`, it is no longer possible to send or receive messages.

### `subprocess.disconnect()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_disconnect)

Added in: v0.7.2

Closes the IPC channel between parent and child, allowing the child to exit gracefully once there are no other connections keeping it alive. After calling this method the `subprocess.connected` and `process.connected` properties in both the parent and child (respectively) will be set to `false`, and it will be no longer possible to pass messages between the processes.

The `'disconnect'` event will be emitted when there are no messages in the process of being received. This will most often be triggered immediately after calling `subprocess.disconnect()`.

When the child process is a Node.js instance (e.g. spawned using [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options)), the `process.disconnect()` method can be invoked within the child process to close the IPC channel as well.

### `subprocess.exitCode`[#](#child_process_subprocess_exitcode)

*   [<integer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type)

The `subprocess.exitCode` property indicates the exit code of the child process. If the child process is still running, the field will be `null`.

### `subprocess.kill([signal])`[#](#child_process_subprocess_kill_signal)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   `signal` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) | [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)
*   Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

The `subprocess.kill()` method sends a signal to the child process. If no argument is given, the process will be sent the `'SIGTERM'` signal. See [`signal(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) for a list of available signals. This function returns `true` if [`kill(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html) succeeds, and `false` otherwise.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
    
    grep.on('close', (code, signal) => {
      console.log(
        `child process terminated due to receipt of signal ${signal}`);
    });
    
    
    grep.kill('SIGHUP');

The [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object may emit an [`'error'`](#child_process_event_error) event if the signal cannot be delivered. Sending a signal to a child process that has already exited is not an error but may have unforeseen consequences. Specifically, if the process identifier (PID) has been reassigned to another process, the signal will be delivered to that process instead which can have unexpected results.

While the function is called `kill`, the signal delivered to the child process may not actually terminate the process.

See [`kill(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html) for reference.

On Linux, child processes of child processes will not be terminated when attempting to kill their parent. This is likely to happen when running a new process in a shell or with the use of the `shell` option of `ChildProcess`:

    'use strict';
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(
      'sh',
      [
        '-c',
        `node -e "setInterval(() => {
          console.log(process.pid, 'is alive')
        }, 500);"`,
      ], {
        stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit']
      }
    );
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      subprocess.kill(); 
    }, 2000);

### `subprocess.killed`[#](#child_process_subprocess_killed)

Added in: v0.5.10

*   [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Set to `true` after `subprocess.kill()` is used to successfully send a signal to the child process.

The `subprocess.killed` property indicates whether the child process successfully received a signal from `subprocess.kill()`. The `killed` property does not indicate that the child process has been terminated.

### `subprocess.pid`[#](#child_process_subprocess_pid)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<integer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) | [<undefined>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Undefined_type)

Returns the process identifier (PID) of the child process. If the child process fails to spawn due to errors, then the value is `undefined` and `error` is emitted.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
    
    console.log(`Spawned child pid: ${grep.pid}`);
    grep.stdin.end();

### `subprocess.ref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_ref)

Added in: v0.7.10

Calling `subprocess.ref()` after making a call to `subprocess.unref()` will restore the removed reference count for the child process, forcing the parent to wait for the child to exit before exiting itself.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: 'ignore'
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();
    subprocess.ref();

### `subprocess.send(message[, sendHandle[, options]][, callback])`[#](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback)

*   `message` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
*   `sendHandle` [<Handle>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_server_listen_handle_backlog_callback)
*   `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) The `options` argument, if present, is an object used to parameterize the sending of certain types of handles. `options` supports the following properties:
    *   `keepOpen` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) A value that can be used when passing instances of `net.Socket`. When `true`, the socket is kept open in the sending process. **Default:** `false`.
*   `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
*   Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

When an IPC channel has been established between the parent and child ( i.e. when using [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options)), the `subprocess.send()` method can be used to send messages to the child process. When the child process is a Node.js instance, these messages can be received via the [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event.

The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting message might not be the same as what is originally sent.

For example, in the parent script:

    const cp = require('child_process');
    const n = cp.fork(`${__dirname}/sub.js`);
    
    n.on('message', (m) => {
      console.log('PARENT got message:', m);
    });
    
    
    n.send({ hello: 'world' });

And then the child script, `'sub.js'` might look like this:

    process.on('message', (m) => {
      console.log('CHILD got message:', m);
    });
    
    
    process.send({ foo: 'bar', baz: NaN });

Child Node.js processes will have a [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) method of their own that allows the child to send messages back to the parent.

There is a special case when sending a `{cmd: 'NODE_foo'}` message. Messages containing a `NODE_` prefix in the `cmd` property are reserved for use within Node.js core and will not be emitted in the child's [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event. Rather, such messages are emitted using the `'internalMessage'` event and are consumed internally by Node.js. Applications should avoid using such messages or listening for `'internalMessage'` events as it is subject to change without notice.

The optional `sendHandle` argument that may be passed to `subprocess.send()` is for passing a TCP server or socket object to the child process. The child will receive the object as the second argument passed to the callback function registered on the [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event. Any data that is received and buffered in the socket will not be sent to the child.

The optional `callback` is a function that is invoked after the message is sent but before the child may have received it. The function is called with a single argument: `null` on success, or an [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error) object on failure.

If no `callback` function is provided and the message cannot be sent, an `'error'` event will be emitted by the [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object. This can happen, for instance, when the child process has already exited.

`subprocess.send()` will return `false` if the channel has closed or when the backlog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that makes it unwise to send more. Otherwise, the method returns `true`. The `callback` function can be used to implement flow control.

#### Example: sending a server object[#](#child_process_example_sending_a_server_object)

The `sendHandle` argument can be used, for instance, to pass the handle of a TCP server object to the child process as illustrated in the example below:

    const subprocess = require('child_process').fork('subprocess.js');
    
    
    const server = require('net').createServer();
    server.on('connection', (socket) => {
      socket.end('handled by parent');
    });
    server.listen(1337, () => {
      subprocess.send('server', server);
    });

The child would then receive the server object as:

    process.on('message', (m, server) => {
      if (m === 'server') {
        server.on('connection', (socket) => {
          socket.end('handled by child');
        });
      }
    });

Once the server is now shared between the parent and child, some connections can be handled by the parent and some by the child.

While the example above uses a server created using the `net` module, `dgram` module servers use exactly the same workflow with the exceptions of listening on a `'message'` event instead of `'connection'` and using `server.bind()` instead of `server.listen()`. This is, however, currently only supported on Unix platforms.

#### Example: sending a socket object[#](#child_process_example_sending_a_socket_object)

Similarly, the `sendHandler` argument can be used to pass the handle of a socket to the child process. The example below spawns two children that each handle connections with "normal" or "special" priority:

    const { fork } = require('child_process');
    const normal = fork('subprocess.js', ['normal']);
    const special = fork('subprocess.js', ['special']);
    
    
    
    const server = require('net').createServer({ pauseOnConnect: true });
    server.on('connection', (socket) => {
    
      
      if (socket.remoteAddress === '74.125.127.100') {
        special.send('socket', socket);
        return;
      }
      
      normal.send('socket', socket);
    });
    server.listen(1337);

The `subprocess.js` would receive the socket handle as the second argument passed to the event callback function:

    process.on('message', (m, socket) => {
      if (m === 'socket') {
        if (socket) {
          
          
          
          socket.end(`Request handled with ${process.argv[2]} priority`);
        }
      }
    });

Do not use `.maxConnections` on a socket that has been passed to a subprocess. The parent cannot track when the socket is destroyed.

Any `'message'` handlers in the subprocess should verify that `socket` exists, as the connection may have been closed during the time it takes to send the connection to the child.

### `subprocess.signalCode`[#](#child_process_subprocess_signalcode)

*   [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<null>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Null_type)

The `subprocess.signalCode` property indicates the signal received by the child process if any, else `null`.

### `subprocess.spawnargs`[#](#child_process_subprocess_spawnargs)

*   [<Array>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

The `subprocess.spawnargs` property represents the full list of command-line arguments the child process was launched with.

### `subprocess.spawnfile`[#](#child_process_subprocess_spawnfile)

*   [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

The `subprocess.spawnfile` property indicates the executable file name of the child process that is launched.

For [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options), its value will be equal to [`process.execPath`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_execpath). For [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), its value will be the name of the executable file. For [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), its value will be the name of the shell in which the child process is launched.

### `subprocess.stderr`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stderr)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<stream.Readable>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)

A `Readable Stream` that represents the child process's `stderr`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[2]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`, then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stderr` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[2]`. Both properties will refer to the same value.

The `subprocess.stderr` property can be `null` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.stdin`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stdin)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<stream.Writable>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)

A `Writable Stream` that represents the child process's `stdin`.

If a child process waits to read all of its input, the child will not continue until this stream has been closed via `end()`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[0]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`, then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stdin` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[0]`. Both properties will refer to the same value.

The `subprocess.stdin` property can be `undefined` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.stdio`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stdio)

Added in: v0.7.10

*   [<Array>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

A sparse array of pipes to the child process, corresponding with positions in the [`stdio`](#child_process_options_stdio) option passed to [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) that have been set to the value `'pipe'`. `subprocess.stdio[0]`, `subprocess.stdio[1]`, and `subprocess.stdio[2]` are also available as `subprocess.stdin`, `subprocess.stdout`, and `subprocess.stderr`, respectively.

In the following example, only the child's fd `1` (stdout) is configured as a pipe, so only the parent's `subprocess.stdio[1]` is a stream, all other values in the array are `null`.

    const assert = require('assert');
    const fs = require('fs');
    const child_process = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = child_process.spawn('ls', {
      stdio: [
        0, 
        'pipe', 
        fs.openSync('err.out', 'w'), 
      ]
    });
    
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[0], null);
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[0], subprocess.stdin);
    
    assert(subprocess.stdout);
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[1], subprocess.stdout);
    
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[2], null);
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[2], subprocess.stderr);

The `subprocess.stdio` property can be `undefined` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.stdout`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stdout)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<stream.Readable>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)

A `Readable Stream` that represents the child process's `stdout`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[1]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`, then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stdout` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[1]`. Both properties will refer to the same value.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn('ls');
    
    subprocess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`Received chunk ${data}`);
    });

The `subprocess.stdout` property can be `null` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.unref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_unref)

Added in: v0.7.10

By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent the parent from waiting for a given `subprocess` to exit, use the `subprocess.unref()` method. Doing so will cause the parent's event loop to not include the child in its reference count, allowing the parent to exit independently of the child, unless there is an established IPC channel between the child and the parent.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: 'ignore'
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();

`maxBuffer` and Unicode[#](#child_process_maxbuffer_and_unicode)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The `maxBuffer` option specifies the largest number of bytes allowed on `stdout` or `stderr`. If this value is exceeded, then the child process is terminated. This impacts output that includes multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16. For instance, `console.log('中文测试')` will send 13 UTF-8 encoded bytes to `stdout` although there are only 4 characters.

Shell requirements[#](#child_process_shell_requirements)
--------------------------------------------------------

The shell should understand the `-c` switch. If the shell is `'cmd.exe'`, it should understand the `/d /s /c` switches and command-line parsing should be compatible.

Default Windows shell[#](#child_process_default_windows_shell)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Although Microsoft specifies `%COMSPEC%` must contain the path to `'cmd.exe'` in the root environment, child processes are not always subject to the same requirement. Thus, in `child_process` functions where a shell can be spawned, `'cmd.exe'` is used as a fallback if `process.env.ComSpec` is unavailable.

Advanced serialization[#](#child_process_advanced_serialization)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Added in: v13.2.0, v12.16.0

Child processes support a serialization mechanism for IPC that is based on the [serialization API of the `v8` module](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/v8.html#v8_serialization_api), based on the [HTML structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm). This is generally more powerful and supports more built-in JavaScript object types, such as `BigInt`, `Map` and `Set`, `ArrayBuffer` and `TypedArray`, `Buffer`, `Error`, `RegExp` etc.

However, this format is not a full superset of JSON, and e.g. properties set on objects of such built-in types will not be passed on through the serialization step. Additionally, performance may not be equivalent to that of JSON, depending on the structure of the passed data. Therefore, this feature requires opting in by setting the `serialization` option to `'advanced'` when calling [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) or [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options).

# How to use Docker build secrets

It's common to need access to secret data to fully build an application from scratch. Commonly, builds pull sources or binaries from a private repository that requires authentication - private PyPI, npm, NuGet, etc. It's also common to use a Dockerfile to perform application build and packaging when deploying apps as containers, to take advantage of an isolated environment. This presents a challenge, as we don't want any secrets (files, environment variables, etc) to be captured in our image layers.

Docker 18.09 added some [nice build enhancements](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information), including a feature called build secrets, that help us solve just this. The idea is simple: mount a volume at build time, use it in a `RUN` command, then don't include it in our final image.

## An example

This is an example of using build secrets with Python to pull from a private package repository. I'm using this [simple_package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-pipelines-python/tree/master/src/simple_package) and I'm also making the assumption that if you're reading this post, you have this problem and you already know how to build a Python package & upload it to a repository somewhere.

### TL;DR:

Run this, study the annotations as needed

```bash
# Pass the path to your pip.conf (secret) and build an image
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --secret id=pipconfig,src=/path/to/some/pip.conf -t myapp --progress=plain . 
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 myapp
```

### Color commentary

#### Dockerfile

* It has to start with `# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.0-experimental` to light up the ability to use the new syntax
* We reference a secret by `id`, in this case `pipconfig`. This should match the `id` you pass in during `docker build`
* We also set a destination to control where the mount lands. Otherwise it lands under `/run/secrets/{id}`

#### `docker build`

* BuildKit changes the output, so it can be hard to see what's going on. `--progress=plain` gives a more familiar "Oh look, pip is installing packages" experience

## <a name="chapter1"/> Chapter 1 - Good Parts
> Most programming languages contain good parts and bad parts. I discovered that I could be a better programmer by using only the good parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build something good out of bad parts?

The best parts of Javascript include:
* functions
* loose typing (variables are declared as variables, without a type)
* dynamic objects
* object literal notation (where you can create an object already with a list of key/value pairs inside curly braces)

The worst parts include global variables - there is a common _global object_ namespace where they're all lumped together and they're essential to the language.

Javascript has a _class free_ object makeup, relying instead on objects inheriting properties directly from other objects - this is **prototypal inheritance**.


## <a name="chapter2"/> Chapter 2 - Grammar

Always use // for comments, even multi-line ones to avoid having to escape `/*` characters.

### Numbers

* There is a single, 64-bit floating point number type.
* `NaN` (Not-a-Number) is not equal to any value (including itself) and is essentially an **illegal number value**, but _typeOf(NaN)===number is true_
* Use `isNaN(number)` to check for NaNs

Number methods are discussed in [Chapter 8](#chapter8).

### Strings

* 16-bit character set and don't have character types.
* Backslashes (\\\) are used for **escaping characters** that could cause problems in strings.
* Strings are **immutable**.

Single quotes are often used to define a String in JavaScript, but if a person's name has an apostrophe
(and the developer does not know the difference between an apostrophe and single quote) it is useful to "escape"
the apostrophe character:

```javascript
var name = 'Patrick O\'Brian'; // using a backslash in front of the apostrophe
console.log('name:', name); // name: Patrick O'Brian
```

![BackSlashExample](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25989405/e47ff6aa-36f3-11e7-9e3d-c7a3da6f1872.png "Backslash Example ")


String methods are discussed in [Chapter 8](#chapter8).

### Statements

* _Inside_ a function, the var statement creates variables local to that function
* _switch, while, for_ and _do_ statements can have an optional **label**  which can be used with `break` and `continue` to provide more precise [control over exactly which statement to break or continue](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/practice.cgi?file=javascript_19). Format: `labelname: statement` and then `continue labelname;`
* ES2015 presents two new keywords for declaring variables, _let_ and _const_. Whereas the _var_ keyword is function scoped (the variables are local to the function), _let_ and _const_ are both block scoped, which means they are local to any statement with {}.
* _falsy_ values:
	* false
	* null
	* undefined
	* Empty string ' '
	* The number 0
	* The number NaN
* All other values are _truthy_ including all objects & the string 'false'
* If no matches are found in `case` statements, the optional default statement is executed, otherwise the matching case statement is carried out
* When using a _for in_ loop, usually a good idea to use `hasOwnProperty(variable)` to **make sure the property belongs to the object you want** and is not instead an inherited property from the prototype chain:
```javascript
for (myvariable in object) {
		if (object.hasOwnProperty(myvariable)) {
		... //statements to be executed
		}
}
```
* A _do while_ statement is always executed at least once as the while condition is only checked after the first iteration of the loop
* `catch` clause in a _try_ statement **must create a new variable** that will catch the exception object
* Scope of `throw` statement is the `try` block it's in, or the `try` of the function it's in
* If there is no `return` statement, `return===undefined`
* `break` exits the statement and `continue` forces a new iteration of the loop, both with the optional _label_ mentioned above

### Expressions

* For `expression ? expression2 : expression3`, if expression is _truthy_, execute expresion2; if it's _falsy_, execute expression3
*  _Invocation_ is `(expression1, expression2, etc)`
*  _refinement_ is either `.name` or `[expression]` as used in an array

### Literals

* _Names_ or _strings_ used for specifying new objects ([**object literals**](#chapter3)) or arrays ([**array literals**](#chapter6))
* Properties of the object are expressions and must be known at compile time

### Functions
* A function literal defines a function value
* More details in [Chapter 4](#chapter4)


## <a name="chapter3"/> Chapter 3 - Objects

Javascript simple types:
* numbers _(has object-like methods but they are immutable)_
* strings _(has object-like methods but they are immutable)_
* booleans _(has object-like methods but they are immutable)_
* null
* undefined

**All other values are _objects_** including arrays and functions.

Objects are **class free**, can contain other objects and can inherit properties from their prototypes (which can _reduce object initialisation time and memory consumption_).

### Object Literals

* An object literal is _zero or more comma-separated name/value pairs surrounded by curly braces_ {}

```javascript

var empty_object = {};

var today = {
	day: "Wednesday",
	month: "April",
	year: 2014,

	weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
		morning: "sunny",
		afternoon: "cloudy"
	}
}
```

### Retrieval

* Can be done with either dot notation `today.weather.morning` or with square brackets `today['month']`
* Or operand (||) can be used to fill in default values for nonexistent data to prevent and _undefined_ error: `var weath = today.weather.evening || "unknown"`


### Update

* Assigning a property value to an object **overwrites** any existing property values with that property name

### Reference

* Objects refer to each other, they don't hold duplicate copies of data

### Prototype

* Every object has a prototype object from which it inherits properties
* _Object.prototype_ comes standard with Javascript and is almost like a 'root parent'
![Object prototype diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NdiIkHd9Cg2j6W4QcJ1X3DEhGXD2gacMXRuURcoE5T4/pub?w=960&h=720 "Object prototype diagram from @sporto")
* The `Object.create` method is now available in ES5 (but the method is in the book if required for older versions)
* If an object does not have a property you ask it for, it will **keep looking up the prototype chain until it finds it**
	* If the property *does note exist* anywhere in the chain, it will return _undefined_
* A new property is _immediately visible_ to all of the objects below it in the chain once created

More details in [Chapter 6](#chapter6)

### Reflection

* Determining what properties an object has
* Using `typeof` **includes all properties in the prototype chain** including functions
* To avoid inherited properties, use `hasOwnProperty(type);` which returns _true_ if that property exists only in that object itself (not the chain)
```javascript
today.hasOwnProperty('number')  //will return true
today.hasOwnProperty('constructor')   //will return false
```

### Enumeration

* Best way to enumerate all the properties you want is a for loop:
```javascript
var i;
var properties = [
	'day', 'month', 'year'
	];
for (i = 0; i < properties.length; i++) {
	document.writeIn(properties[i] + ':' + today[properties[i]]);
}
```
* This ensures you get the **properties you want** (i.e. not up the prototype chain) and in the **order you want**, as opposed to a _for in_ loop which achieves neither of these

### Delete

* Removes property from object, but also **reveals property from further up the prototype chain** if it exists
* Format: `delete today.month`

### Global Abatement

* One way to mitigate the risks of global variables is to _create a single global variable_ which then contains your whole application

```javascript
var MYAPP = {}

MYAPP.today = {
	day: "Wednesday",
	month: "April",
	year: 2014,

	weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
		morning: "sunny",
		afternoon: "cloudy"
	}
}
//Making sure all other variables (like today) are contained within this one global variable (MYAPP) means none of them have global scope and therefore the risk of naming conflicts, etc in your application is reduced
```
* [Closures](#chapter4) are also a way of mitigating the risks of global variables
* Note: **Most [Javascript MVCs](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/) these days (2014) will take care of wrapping your app for you**


## <a name="chapter4"/> Chapter 4 - Functions
> The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions.

### Function Objects

* Functions are objects linked to _function.prototype_ (which is linked to _Object.prototype_).
* As well as usual object behaviour, they can be **invoked**.

### Function Literal

* A function literal has 4 parts:
	* The (reserved) word `function` itself
	* An _optional_ name (un-named functions are considered _anonymous_ functions)
	* Comma-seperated parameters of the function, in parentheses - `(parameters)`
	* Set of statements in curly brackets to be carried out when the function is invoked - `{statements}`

```javascript
//Format of a function
function name (parameterA, parameterB){
	statements;
}
```
<a name="nestedFunctions"/>
* Functions can be nested within functions and the inner function can access all the parameters of the outer function as well as its own

### Invocation

* Stops the current function from running and tells the function you have invoked both to start and to use the arguments (values in parentheses) you have passed it in the invocation `function (parameters)`
	* If arguments > number of arguments expected, the **extra values will be ignored**
	* If arguments < number of arguments expected, the function will assume **undefined in place of the missing arguments**
	* No error is thrown

* **Note:** The difference between an _argument_ and a _parameter_ is that a parameter is usually what is used in the function literal, when you're setting up the function (almost like the placeholder for the actual values that the function will use when it is active) and an argument is usually the value passed to a function at the time it is invoked
* Parameters `this` and `arguments` are also passed to the function when it is invoked, but their value depends on how the function is invoked

#### Method Invocation Pattern

* When a function is **stored as the property of the object** (invoked with a dot . expression) it is called on and is called a _method_
```javascript
myObject.incrementFunction();
```
* The method is **bound to the object** and therefore can use `this` to **retrieve or update values from the object**
* These methods are **highly reusable**
* Because their _object context_ comes from `this` they are considered _public methods_

#### Function Invocation Pattern

* When a function is _not_ the property of an object, it is invoked as a _function_
```javascript
var sum = add(3, 4);
```
* These functions are **bound to the global object** (_a "mistake in the design of the language" according to Douglas Crockford)_ and consequently so is `this`[even in inner functions](#nestedFunctions)
* Invoking `this` within an inner function will therefore refer to its _own_ `this` and **not** the one in global scope

**Workaround:** Artificially create a new `this`:
```javascript
myObject.double = function() {
	//in the book, the var here is called `that` but name changed for clarity
	var globalScopeThis = this; //workaround

	var innerFunc = function() {
		globalScopeThis.value = add(globalScopeThis.value, globalScopeThis.value);
	};

	innerFunc(); //invoke innerFunc as function
};

myObject.double();
console.log(myObject.value);
```

#### Constructor Invocation Pattern

* When a function is created with `new`, that function contains a link to the function's prototype
* This means that methods that were created for the **prototype function are also available** to the function created using `new`

```javascript
//create a function Quo that takes a string - Quo will be our prototype function as we will see
var Quo = function (string){
	this.status = string;
}

//Now create a get_status method for Quo - this will be a public method
Quo.prototype.get_status = function () {
	return this.status;
}

//create a new instance of Quo using the prefix NEW
var myQuo = new Quo("happy");

//because of the use of the new prefix, myQuo is an instance of Quo which means it can access the public method get_status from it's prototype
document.writeIn(myQuo.get_status());     //returns 'happy'
```
* **This style of constructor pattern is not recommended**, there will be better examples in [Chapter 5](#chapter5) - this is noted again in [Appendix B](#new)
* The first letter of a constructor function (in this case Quo) **must _always_ be capitalized**

#### Apply Invocation Pattern

* The `apply` method lets you **choose the value to be bound to `this`**
* It also takes the parameters for a function in an array
* Format:   `function.apply(valueForThis, arrayOfParamentersForFunction);`

```javascript
var array = [5, 2]    //will be the parameters for our function
var sum = add.apply(null, array);     //value of 'this' is null and value of sum is 7 as the 'apply' method passes 5 and 2 to the 'add' method
```

### Arguments

* Another default parameter of functions is the `arguments` array which contains all the arguments that were supplied when the function was invoked
* This means you don't have to know the exact number of arguments when you build a function because you can loop through all the arguments provided at invocation with the use of the default `arguments` array
```javascript
//inside the function
for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
	dosomething;  //e.g. sum +=arguments[i]
}
```
* `arguments` **lacks all the array methods except .length** because of a bug

### Return

* When a function gets to a `return` statement, it returns immediately **without carrying out the remaining statements in the function**
* A function **always returns a `value`** or if unspecified, it returns `undefined`
* "If the function was invoked with the `new` prefix (used when creating a new object so it **must** return an object) and the `return` value is not an object, then `this` (the new object) is returned instead."

### Exceptions

* A `throw` statement interrupts the execution of the code is used to handle expected exceptions like an incorrect type of argument (e.g. a string where a number is expected)
* Each `throw` statement should have an **exception object** with a `name` holding the type of exception and a `message` with an explanation of it + any other properties you like
```javascript
//Thinking through what exceptions could happen in an add function, the main function contains the throw statement with the exception object
var add = function (a,b) {
	if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number'){
		throw {
			name: 'TypeError';
			message: 'The add function requires numbers';
		}
	}
	return a + b;
}
```
* When you write a function to use _add()_, you include a `try` block where the exception object from the `throw` statement in _add()_ will pass control to a **single catch clause for all exceptions**

```javascript
//When you use the function later on, add a try block with a catch clause to catch the exception object
var try_it = function () {
	try{
		add("seven");   //will throw an exception as it is not a number
	}
	catch (e) {
		document.writeIn(e.name + ':' + e.message);
	}
}

try_it();    //you could rewrite this function so the argument is passed in here where it is invoked
```

### Augmenting Types

* Adding a method to the prototype of an object `Object.prototype` (or function, array, string, number, regular expression or boolean), you make it available to all the instances of that object so you don't have to use the `prototype` property again
* By augmenting the _basic types_ (essentially the root prototypes), we can improve Javascript overall
* For example, adding a method named _trim_ to remove spaces from the end of strings, available to all String instances in your code:
```javascript
String.method ('trim', function () {
	return this.replace(/ˆ\s+|\s+$/g, '');     //uses regular expression
});
```
* To be on the safe side, create a method conditionally, **only when you know the method is missing**

```javascript
//Makes a method available to all functions, ONLY when it definitely does not already exist

Function.prototype.method (methodName, func) {
	if (!this.prototype[methodName]){
		this.prototype[methodName] = func;
		return this;
	}
};
```
* Remember that **_for in_ statements don't work well with prototypes**

### Recursion

* Used when a task can be divided into **simple sub-problems** and a function can _call itself repeatedly_ to solve them
Takes the format:

```javascript
var variable = function functionName (parameters){
	//wrap the statements to be executed and the recursive call in a loop statement so it doesn't recurse forever
	//statements to be executed in the function;
	functionName(arguments);
};

functionName (initialArguments); //initial call to the function
```
* Javascript **does not have _tail recursion optimization_** and therefore does not optimize recursive functions - this also means they sometimes fail if they "recurse very deeply"; On a side note, _tail call optimization_ is now supported in [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-tail-position-calls)

### Scope

* A _block_ is a set of statements contained in curly brackets {}
* Javascript **does not have block scope** but **does have function scope**
	* All variables declared _anywhere_ within a function are **available everywhere in that function** - i.e. and inner function will have access to the variables of the outer function in which it is defined
	* A variable can be _overwritten_ with a new value in an inner function and that new value's scope will be just the body of the inner function - as soon as you're back out to the outer function, the value of that variable will revert to what it was before the inner function began its execution
	* All variable should be **declared at the top of the function body**

### Closure

* Inner functions have **access to the actual parameters of the outer functions (not copies)**
* If an object is created as a result of a function and assigned to myObject, myObject continues to share access to the variables in the functions that created it (actual variables, not copies)
	* It has access to _the context in which it was created_ - this is _closure_
	* This includes later on, even if _the outer function has completed its execution and returned_, when the inner function is called, it will still have **access to all the variables it had access to at the time it was defined** (i.e. the variables that were _in context_ when the inner function was defined)

### Callbacks

* A _callback function_ is a function passed to another function as a parameter and executed in this other function
* When making a request to a server, use an _asynchronous request_ as asynchronous functions return immediately, therefore freeing up the client
	* In this example, we pass the callback function to the asynchronous request as a parameter so the callback function will only be called when a response is available
```javascript
request = prepare_the_request();
send_request_asynchronously(request, function(response){     //function being passed in as a parameter
	display(response);
});
```

### <a name="Module"/> Module

* A module is a function or object whose contents can be used, but its state and implementation are hidden
* It is essentially using function scope and closures keep the variables and functions contained within as private as well as binding them to a non-global object - **whilst still being accessible**
* Using the _module pattern_ is **widely used and good practice** as it promotes information hiding (avoiding naming conflicts, etc) and encapsulation
	* This is a [good article on how to use the module pattern](http://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-structure-javascript-the-module-pattern-edition/) with examples
* It can also be used to produce **secure objects** (see [durable objects](#DurableObject) below)
	* Methods contained in the object do not make use of `this` or `that` so it becomes impossible to change them from outside of the object except in ways explicitly permitted by the methods (like passing them a parameter)
	* The methods can be _replaced_ but the secrets of how these methods function (like how they generate a number for example) can't be revealed because they are not tied to a global object
```javascript
var Serial_maker = function() {

	//all variables defined in this object are now fixed and hidden from anything outside this function
	//see page 42 of book for full example
};
//calls to methods passing them parameters are made here
```
* **Note:** Whilst Javascript variables are usually lowercase, there is some convention around capitalizing the first letter of a Module

### Cascade

* Some methods return nothing, albeit `undefined`
* If we alter these methods to **return `this` instead of `undefined`**, they return the object which can then be passed to the next method, e.g `getElement(myBox).move(350,150)` gets the element and then passes is to the _move_ function for the next action
	* This enables _cascades_, where you **call many methods on the same object in sequence because the object is passed from one method to the next** (usually separated by `.` as above)
* Cascades also stop you from trying to do too much in one method and makes your code more descriptive

### Curry

* A `curry` method allows you to _partially evaluate_ an existing function
	* An example is below where the function _expects **two** arguments_, but it is first invoked with only **one**  (in this case using `curry` as in `add.curry(10);`) and then later passed the second argument
* It can also be explained as transforming a function that takes multiple arguments (`add(a,b)`) into a chain of functions that take a single argument each (`addA = add(A); addA(B);` where the two functions are now `add()` & `addA()`)

```javascript
//set up a simple function that we will customise with curry
var add = function (a,b){
	return a + b;
}

var addTen = add.curry(10);      //passes 10 as the first argument to the add() function
addTen(20);                     //The use of the curry method in addTen means addTen === add(10, 20);
```
* Javascript **does not have a `curry` method** natively but this can be added to the `Function.protoype`:
```javascript
Function.method('curry', function() {
	var slice = Array.prototype.slice,
		args = slice.apply(arguments),
		that = this;
	return function () {
		return that.apply(null, args.concat(slice.apply(arguments)));
	}
});
```

### Memoization

* Storing the results of previous operations in objects (such as arrays) allows them to be reused **without having to keep recalculating the value** - this optimization is called _memoization_
	* Adding an object to store the results _memoizes the function_
* Particularly useful when a function is **recursive** and uses the results of its previous iteration in the current iteration
* A _memoizer_ function can be created to help memoize future functions:
```javascript
var meoizer = function (memo, fundamental) {
	var shell = function (n) {
		var result = memo[n];
		if (typeof result !== 'number') {
			result = fundamental(shell, n);
			memo[n] = result;
		}
		return result;
	}
	return shell;
}
```


## <a name="chapter5"/> Chapter 5 - Inheritance
>Javascript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects

Main benefit of inheritance is **code reuse** - you only have to specify differences.

Javascript can _mimic_ classical inheritance but has a much **richer set of code reuse patterns**
* This chapter looks at the more straightforward patterns but it is always best to **keep it simple**

### Pseudoclassical

* The pseudoclassical code reuse pattern essentially has constructor functions (functions invoked using the `new` prefix) work like classes to mimic the classical structure
	* All properties are public
	* If you forget to use the `new` prefix, `this` is not bound to the new object - it is instead bound to the global object and you'll be unwittingly altering these instead!

* There is no need to use it, **there are better code reuse patterns in JavaScript**

### Object Specifiers

Rather than: `var myObject = maker (f, l, m, c, s)` which has too many parameters to remember in the right order, use an _object specifier_:
```javascript
var myObject = maker ({      //note curly braces
	first: f,
	last: l,
	state: s,
	city: c
	}
;)
```
to contain them. They can now be **listed in any order**

Also useful to pass object specifiers to JSON ([see Appendix E notes](#AppendixE))

### Prototypal

* Zero classes, **one object inherits from another**
* Create an object literal of a useful object and then make an instance of it using the format `var myObject = Object.create(originalObjectName)`
* When you then customise the new object (adding properties or methods through the dot notation for example), this is _differential inheritance_, where you specify the **differences from the original object**

### Functional

* **All properties of an object are visible** (Javascript has no classes so there is no such thing as a 'private variable' which can only be seen within a class as per other languages)
* When you use a _function_ to create your original object and the same with the object instances, you're essentially utilising Javascript functional scope to create private properties and methods
The below is an example of how you would create an original object, the `name` and `saying` properties are now completely private and only accessible to the `get_name` and `says` method

```javascript
var mammal = function (spec) {
	var that = {};    //that is a new object which is basically a container of 'secrets' shared to the rest of the inheritance chain

	that.get_name = function () {
		return spec.name;
	};

	that.says = function () {
		return spec.saying || '';  //returns an empty string if no 'saying' argument is passed through the spec object when calling mammal
	};
	return that;     //returns the object that contains the now private properties and methods (under functional scope)
}

var myMammal = mammal({name: 'Herb'});
```
Creating an object 'cat' can now inherit from the `mammal` constructor and only pay attention to the differences between it and `mammal`:
```javascript
var cat = function (spec) {
	spec.saying = spec.saying || 'meow';   //if spec.saying doesn't already exists, make it 'meow'
	var that = mammal(spec);      //here the object 'container of secrets' is set up inheriting from mammal already

	//functions and property augmentations happen here

	return that;      //as above
}
```
* Requires less effort and gives **better encapsulation** and **information hiding** than the pseudoclassical pattern, as well as **access to super methods** (see page 54 of book for super method example)
* <a name="DurableObject"/> An **object** created using the functional pattern _and_ making **no use of `this` or `that`** is a _durable object_ and cannot be compromised by attackers
	* Briefly also discussed in [Module](#Module) section above
* If you do want something to have access to the object's private properties and methods, you pass it the `that` bundle (i.e. your 'container of secrets')

### Parts
* An object can be composed out of a set of parts
	* For example, you can create a function that provides the object it is passed with a number of methods (which are defined in this function), where each method is a part that is added to the object


## <a name="chapter6"/> Chapter 6 - Arrays

Javascript only has **array-like objects** which are slower than 'real' arrays.

**Retrieval and updating** of properties works the **same as with an object _except with integer property names_**.

Arrays have their **own literal format** and their own set of methods ([Chapter 8 - Methods](#chapter8)).

### Array Literals

* An array literal is a **pair of square brackets surrounding zero or more comma-seperated values** `[a, b, c, etc]`
	* The first value will get the property name '0', the second will be '1' and so on
* Javascript allows an array to contain **any mixture of values**

### Length

* If you add to the array, the `length` property will increase to contain the new element - it will not give an error
* If you set the `.length` to a smaller number than the current length of the array, it will **delete any properties with a subscript >= the new `length`**
* The `push()` method is sometimes useful to add an element to the end of an array
`numbers.push('go')    //adds the element 'go' to the end of the numbers array`


### Delete

* Elements can be deleted from the array object using `delete` but this **leaves a hole in the array**
* Use `array.splice(keyInArray, howManyElementsToDelete)` which changes the keys for the remaining values in the array so there is no hole left
	* May be _slow_

### Enumeration

* A `for` statement can be used to iterate over all the properties of an array (as it is an object)
* **Do not use `for in`** as it does not iterate through the properties in order and sometimes pulls in from further up the prototype chain

### Confusion

> The rule is simple: when the property names [keys] are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object.

* Arrays are most useful when property names are integers _but_ they can also accept strings as property names
* Javascript doesn't have a good way of telling an object from an array as `typeof array === object`
* To accurately detect arrays, have to define our own function:
```javascript
var is_array = function (value) {
	return Object.prototype.toString.apply(value) === '[object Array]';
	//apply(value) binds `value` to `this` & returns true if `this` is an array
}
```

### Methods

* Array methods are stored in `Array.prototype` which can be augmented using the format:
```javascript
//capital A in Array means this refers to the prototype
Array.method('reduce', function (parameters){
	//define variables and function
	//return a value
});
```
* Remember, **every array inherits and can use the methods you add to `Array.prototype`**
* You can also add methods _directly to an array_ because they are objects
	* `myArray.total = function () { //statements to execute; }` adds a 'total' function to the array `myArray`
* **DO NOT USE:** `Object.create()` will create an object - lacking the `length` property - not an array.

### Dimensions

* Using `[]` will create an empty array as they are not initialized in JavaScript
* Accessing a missing element will give you `undefined`
* If you have an algorithm that relies on the array not being empty and not having `undefined` values, you can write a function that will prep your array to have a certain number of defined values, essentially initializing it with certain values in place
	* An `Array.dim` function is outlined on page 63 which will allow `var myArray = Array.dim(10,0)` to make an array with 10 zeroes starting from the first position in the array(0)
* Javascript only has **one dimensional arrays** but **_can_ have array of arrays**
* Two dimensional arrays (matrices) will have to be set up by the programmer
	* page 63 gives a method for this and for explicitly setting cell values so as not to have an empty matrix


## <a name="chapter7"/> Chapter 7 - Regular Expressions
> A _regular expression_ is the specification of the syntax of a simple language

Used with `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`, `string.match`, `string.replace`, `string.search` and `string.split` to interact with string (more in [Chapter 8 - Methods](#chapter8))

Quite convoluted and difficult to read as they **do not allow comments or whitespace** so a JavaScript regular expression **must be on a single line**

### An Example

`/ˆ(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?(\/{0,3})([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)(?::(\d+))?(?:\/([ˆ?#]*))?(?:\?([ˆ#]*))?(?:#(.*))?$/`

Breaking it down one portion ([factor](#Factors)) at a time:
* Note that the string starts and ends with a slash `/`
* `ˆ` indicates the beginning of a string
* `(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?`
	* `(?:...)` indicates a [_noncapturing group_](#Noncapturing), where the '...' is replaced by the group that you wish to match, but not save to anywhere
	* Suffix `?` indicates the group is optional, so it could or could not exist in the string - it could even exist more than once
	* `()` around the _([A-Za-z]+)_ indicates a [_capturing group_](#Capturing) which is therefore captured and placed in the `result` array
		* They groups are placed in the array in order, so the first will appear in `result[1]`
		* **Noncapturing groups are preferred to capturing groups** because capturing groups have a performance penalty (on account of saving to the result array)
		* You can also have **capturing groups _within_ noncapturing groups** such as [`(?:Bob says: (\w+))`](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-disambiguation.html)
	* `[...]` indicates a character class
	* `A-Za-z` is a character class containing all 26 letters of the alphabet in both upper and lower case
	* Suffix `+` means character class will be matched _one or more times_
	* Suffix `:` is matched literally (so the letters will be followed by a colon in this case)
* `(\/{0,3})`
	* `\/` The backslash `\` _escapes_ the forward slash `/` (which traditionally symbolises the end of the regular expression literal) and together they indicate that the forward slash `/` should be matched
	* Suffix `{0,3}` means the slash `/` will be matched between 0 and 3 times
* `([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)`
	* String made up of one or more (note the `+` at the end denoting possible multiple occurrences) digits, letters (upper or lower case), full stops (.) or hyphens (-)
		* Note that the hyphen was escaped with a backslash `\-` as hyphens usually denote a _range_ but in this case is a hyphen within the expression
* `(?::(\d+))?`
	* `\d` represents a _digit character_ so this will be a sequence of _one or more_ digit characters (as per the `+`)
	* The digit characters will be immediately preceded by a colon `:`
	* `(\d+)` will be the fourth capturing group in this expression, it is also _optional_ (`?`) and inside a non-capturing group `(?:...)`
* `(?:\/([ˆ?#]*))?`
	* Another optional group (`?`), beginning with a literal slash `/` (escaped by the backslash)
	* The `ˆ` at the beginning of character class `[ˆ?#]` means it includes _all_ characters _except_ ? and #
		* This actually leaves the regexp open to attack because too many characters are included in the character class
	* The `*` indicates the character class will appear _zero or more_ times
* `(?:\?([ˆ#]*))?`
	* We've seen everything here before: An optional capturing group starting with a literal `?` (escaped by the backslash) with zero or more characters that are not #
* `(?:#(.*))?`
	* Final optional group beginning with a `#`
	* `.` matches any character _except a line ending character_
* `$` represents the end of a string

* Note: **`ˆ` and `$` are important because they anchor the regexp** and checks whether the string matched against it contains _only_ what is in the regexp
	* If `ˆ` and `$` weren't present, it would check that the string _contained_ the regexp but wouldn't necessarily be only made up of this
	* Using only `ˆ` checks the string _starts_ with the regexp
	* Using only `$` checks the string _ends_ with the regexp

**Another example**
`/ˆ-?\d+(?:\.\d*)?(?:e[+\-]?\d+)?$/i;`

Most of this we have seen before but here are the new bits:
* The `i` at the end means _ignore case_ when matching letters
* `-?` means the minus sign is optional
* `(?:\.\d*)` matches a decimal point followed by _zero or more_ digits (123.6834.4442284 _does not match_)
* Note this expression only uses _noncapturing_ groups

### Construction

3 flags exist in regular expressions: `i` means insensitive - ignore the character case, `g` means global - to match multiple items and `m` means multiline - where ˆ and $ can match line-ending characters

Two ways to build a regular expression:
1. _Regular Expression literals_ as per the examples above start and end with a slash `/`
	* Here the flags are appended after the final slash, for example `/i`
	* Be careful: `RegExp` objects made by regular expression literals share a single instance
2. Use `RegExp` constructor
	* The first parameter is the string to be made into a `RegExp` object, the second is the flag
	* Useful when all information for creating the regular expression is not available at time of programming
	* Backslashes mean something in the constructor, so these must be doubled and quotes must be escaped

```javascript
//example creating a regular expression object that matches a JavaScript string

var my_regexp = new RegExp("'(?:\\\\.|[ˆ\\\\\\'])*'", 'g');
```

### Elements

#### Regexp Choice

`|` provides a match if any of the sequences provided match.

In `"into".match(/in|int/);`, the _in_ will be a match so it doesn't even look at the _int_.

#### Regexp Sequence

A _regexp sequence_ is made up of one or more regexp [factors](#Factors). If there are no quantifiers after the factor (like `?`, `*` or `+`), the factor will be **matched one time**.

#### <a name="Factors"/> Regexp Factor

> A _regexp factor_ can be a character, a parenthesized group, a character class, or an escape sequence.

It's essentially a portion of the full `RegExp`, like what we broke down the regexp above into.

* The following special characters must all be _escaped_ with a backslash `\` to be taken literally, or they will take on an alternative meaning: \ / [ ] ( ) { } ? + * | . ˆ$
* The `\` prefix **does not make letters or digits literal**
* When unescaped:
	* `.` matches any character except line-ending
	* `ˆ` matches the beginning of the text when `lastIndex` property is zero, or matches line-ending character when the `m` flag is present
	* Having `ˆ` inside a [character class](#RegexpClass) means NOT, so [ˆ0-9] means _does not_ match a digit
	* `$` matches the beginning of the text or a line-ending character when the `m` flag is present

#### Regexp Escape

As well as escaping special characters in regexp factors, the backslash has additional uses:
* As in strings, `\f` is the formfeed character, `\n` is new line, `\r` is carriage return, `\t` is tab and `\u` specifies Unicode as a 16-bit hex. But **`\b` is _not_ a backspace character**
* `\d` === [0-9] and `\D` is the opposite, NOT (ˆ) a digit, [ˆ0-9]
* `\s` matches is a partial set of Unicode whitespace characters and `\S` is the opposite
* `\w` === [0-9A-Za-z] and `\W` === [ˆ0-9A-Za-z] but **useless for any real world language** (because of accents on letters, etc)
* `\1` refers to the text captured in group 1 so it is matched again later on in the regexp
	* `\2` refers to group 2, `\3` to group 3 and so on

*`\b` is a _bad part_. It was supposed to be a word-boundary anchor but is useless for multilingual applications

#### Regexp Group

Four kinds of groups:
* <a name="Capturing"/> **Capturing:** `(...)` where each group is captured into the `result` array - the first capturing group in the regexp goes into `result[1]`, the second into `result[2]` and so on
* <a name="Noncapturing"/> **Noncapturing** `(?:...)` where the text is matched, but not captured and saved anywhere, making is _slightly faster_ than a capturing group (has no bearing on numbering of capturing groups)
* _Positive lookahead_, a **bad** part: `(?=...)` acts like a noncapturing group except after the match is made, it goes back to where text started
* _Negative lookahead_, a **bad** part: `(?!...)` is like a positive lookahead but only matches if there is no match with what is in it

#### <a name="RegexpClass"/> Regexp Class

* Conveniently and easily specifies one of a set of characters using square brackets `[]`, for example vowels: `[aeiou]`
* Can shorten specification of all 32 ASCII special characters to **[!-\/:-@\[-\`{-˜]** (note that the \` in this piece of code is a back-tick)
* Also allows `ˆ` as the first character after the opening `[` to mean _NOT_ the characters in the character set

#### Regexp Class Escape

There are **_specific_ characters that must be escaped in a character class**: -  /  [  \  ]  ˆ

#### Regexp Quantifier

A _quantifier_ at the end of a factor indicates how many times the factor should be matched
* A number in curly braces means the factor should match that many times, so `/o{3}` matches _ooo_
* Two comma-seperated numbers in curly braces provide the _range_ of times a factor should match, so `{3,5}` indicates it will match 3, 4 or 5 times
* _Zero or **one**_ times (same thing as saying something is optional) can be `?` or `{0,1}`
* _Zero or **more**_ times can be `*` or `{0,}`
* _One or **more**_ times can be `+` or `{1,}`

**Prefer to use 'zero or more' or 'one or more' matching over the 'zero or one' matching** - i.e. prefer _greedy_ matching over _lazy_ matching


## <a name="chapter8"/> Chapter 8 - Methods

### Arrays

#### _array_.concat(_item..._)
Produces **new array** copying the original array with the `items` appended to it (does not modify the original array like `array.push(item)` does). If the `item` is an array, its elements are appended.

#### _array_.join(_separator_)
Creates a string of all the array's elements, separated by the `separator`. Use an empty string `separator` ('') to join without separation.

#### _array_.pop()
Removes _last element_ of array. Returns `undefined` for empty arrays.

#### _array_.push(_item..._)
**Modifies the _array_**, appending `items` onto the end. Returns the new `length` of the array.

#### _array_.reverse()
_Modifies_ the array by **reversing the order of the elements**.

#### _array_.shift()
Removes the _first_ element of the array (does not leave a hole in the array - same effect as using the `.splice(a,b)` method) and returns that first element.

#### _array_.slice(_start, end_)
Different to `splice`.

'slice' creates a **new array**, copying from the `start` element and stopping at the element _before_ the `end` value given. If no `end` is given, default is `array.length`.

Negative values for `start` and `end` will have `array.length` added to them and if `start`>`end`, it will return an **empty** array.

#### _array_.sort(_comparefn_)
JavaScript has a `sort()` method which was created only to compare strings and therefore sorts numbers incorrectly (it will sort them as 1, 15, 2, 23, 54 for example). Therefore, we have to write a comparison function which returns _0_ if the two elements you are comparing are equal, a _positive number_ if the first element should come first and a _negative number_ if the second element should come first. Then pass this comparison function to `sort()` as a parameter to allow it to sort array elements _intelligently_.

Page 80-82 in the book takes you through various iterations of the comparison functions - for numbers, simple strings, objects and objects with multiple keys (for example if you want to sort objects by first _and_ last names). These should be taken from the book when required.

#### _array_.splice(_start, deleteCount, item..._)
Removes elements from the array making sure there are no holes left in the array. It is most popularly used for deleting elements from an array.

It removes the `deleteCount` number of elements from the array starting from the `start` position. If there are `item` parameters passed to it, it will replace the deleted elements in the array with the `items`.

It returns an **array containing the deleted elements**.

#### _array_.unshift(_item..._)
Works like `push` but adds items **to the front of the array** instead of the end. Returns the new `length` of the array.

### Function

#### _function_.apply(_thisArg, [argArray]_)
The `apply` method invokes a function, passing in the object that will be bound to `this` and _optional_ array of arguments.

### Number

#### _number_.toExponentional(_fractionDigits_)
Converts _number_ to a string in **exponential form** (e.g. 3.14e+0). `fractionDigits` (from 0 to 20) gives the number of decimal places.

#### _number_.toFixed(_fractionDigits_)
Converts _number_ to a string in **decimal form** (e.g. 3.1415927). `fractionDigits` (from 0 to 20) gives the number of decimal places.

#### _number_.toPrecision(_precision_)
Converts _number_ to a string in decimal form (e.g. 3.1415927). The difference from `toFixed` is that `precision` (from 0 to 21) gives the number of **total digits**.

#### _number_.toString(_radix_)
Converts _number_ to a **string**. `radix` is an _optional_ parameter between 2 and 36 and gives the _base_. The default radix is 10.

### Object

#### _object_.hasOwnProperty(_name_)
**Does not look at the property chain**. Returns true if the _object_ contains the property `name`.

### RegExp
#### _regexp_.exec(_string_)
Most powerful (and _slowest_) regexp method.

Checks the `string` against the _regexp_ (starting at position 0) and returns an **array** containing the matches.
The _regexp_ is set up with various capturing groups and these determine the elements that go in the array:
* the 0 element of the array will contain the part of `string` that matched the _regexp_
* element 1 of the array will contain the text captured by the first capturing group in _regexp_
* element 2 of the array will contain the text captured by the second capturing group in _regexp_ and so on
* if the match fails, it returns `null`

If the **_regexp_ contains a `g` flag** (e.g. `var regexp = /[ˆ<>]+|<(\/?)([A-Za-z]+)([ˆ<>]*)>/g;`), there is a lot more to look out for:
* Searching begins at `regexp.lastIndex` (initially zero)
* If a match is found, `lastIndex` becomes the position of the _first character of the match_
* If **no** match is found, `lastIndex` is reset to zero
* If searching for multiple occurrences of a pattern by calling `exec` in a loop, ensure you _reset `lastIndex`_ when exiting the loop and remember `ˆ` only matches _when `lastIndex` is equal to zero_

Example on page 87 of the book is worth reading to improve understanding.

#### _regexp_.test(_string_)
Simplest (and _fastest_) regexp method.

If _regexp_ matches the `string` it returns _true_. Otherwise it returns _false_.
**Do not use the `g` flag with this method**.

### String
#### _string_.charAt(_pos_)
Returns character at position `pos` in the string _starting from 0_. If `pos` is less than zero or bigger than the string itself it return an **empty string**.

#### _string_.charCodeAt(_pos_)
Same as `charAt` except it returns the **integer** that represents the _code point value of the character at position `pos`_.
Returns `NaN` if  _string_.length < `pos` < 0.

#### _string_.concat(_string..._)
Creates **new string** concatenating various strings. `+` tends to be used instead of this method (e.g. `var cat = 'c'+'a'+'t';`)

#### _string_.indexOf(_searchString, position_)
Searches for `searchString` within _string_ starting at position `position` (an optional parameter). If `position` is not provided, search starts at the beginning of the _string_.
Returns the integer _position of the first matched character_ or _-1_ if no match is found.

#### _string_.lastIndexOf(_searchString, position_)
Same as `indexOf` but searches **from the end of the string** instead of the beginning.

#### _string_.localeCompare(_that_)
Compares _string_ to `that` parameter and returns:
* 0 if _string_ === `that`
* -1 if _string_ < `that`

_NB. 'a' < 'A', comparison is not just in length._

#### _string_.match(_regexp_)
Works the same way as `regexp.exec(string)` **if** there is no `g` flag in the `regexp`.

If there is a `g` flag in teh `regexp`, it produces an array of the matches **but excludes the capturing groups**

#### _string_.replace(_searchValue, replaceValue_)
Searches for the `searchValue` in _string_ and replaces it with the `replaceValue`.

If `searchValue` is a:
* **string**, only its _first occurrence_ will be replaced with the `replaceValue`
* **regexp with a g flag**, _all occurrences_ will be replaced with the `replaceValue`; otherwise, only the _first occurrence_ will be replaced

If `replaceValue` is a:
* **string**, a `$` value has a special meaning when used in the `replaceValue` that conveys what to replace - see table on page 90 for possible variations on `$`
* **function**, it is called for each match and the _string result of the function_ is used as the replacement text
	* string result of the first call will replace capture group 1 of the _string_ and so on


#### _string_.search(_regexp_)
Similar to `.indexOf(string)` but takes a `regexp` instead of a `string`, returning the **position of the first match** (or -1 if there is no match).
The `g` flag is **ignored**.

#### _string_.slice(_start, end_)
Creates a **new string** by copying the characters from the `start` position to the character before the `end` position in _string_.

The `end` parameter is _optional_ and defaults to _string_.length. If either parameter is negative, _string_.length is added to it.

#### _string_.split(_separator, limit_)
Creates an **array of strings** by splitting apart _string_ at the points where the `separator` appears (e.g. if the separator is '.', ab.cd' becomes ['ab', 'cd']).
* If separator is an _empty string_, an array of single characters is produced.
* `limit` is _optional_ and determines how many pieces are to be split off from the original _string_.
* The `separator` can be a `regexp` but
	* text from capturing groups within the regexp will be included in the split - e.g. in `var e = text.split(/\s*(,)\s*/);` the commas (,) will each be included as a separate element in the resulting array
	* some systems _ignore empty strings_ when the `separator` is a `regexp`

#### _string_.substring(_start, end_)
No reason to use, **use `slice` instead**.

#### _string_.toLocaleLowerCase()
Produces a **new string** converted to lower case, _using the rules for the particular locale_ (geography).

#### _string_.toLocaleUpperCase()
Produces a **new string** converted to upper case, _using the rules for the particular locale_ (geography).

#### _string_.toLowerCase()
Produces a **new string** converted to lower case.

#### _string_.toUpperCase()
Produces a **new string** converted to upper case.

#### String.fromCharCode(_char..._)
Produces a **new string** from a series of numbers.
`var a = String.fromCharCode(67, 97, 116);    //a === 'Cat'`
_NB. You're calling the prototype here, not replacing 'String' with your own variable._


## <a name="chapter9"/> Chapter 9 - Style
> JavaScripts's loose typing and excessive error tolerance provide little compile-time assurance of our programs' quality, so to compensate, we should code with strict discipline.

* We should **avoid** the _bad parts_ of JavaScript, but also the **useful parts that can be occasionally dangerous**
>the likelihood a program will work [as intended] is significantly enhanced by our ability to read it

* Must be written in a clear, consistent style, including:
	* Good use of whitespace
	* Put at most one statement on a line
	* If you have to break a statement into 2 or more lines, indent the 2nd line onwards (an extra four spaces)
	* _Always_ use blocks (curly braces {}) with structured statements like `if` and `while` to avoid confusion on what the statement is actually doing
		* Put the opening brace `{` on the same (first) line as the statement to avoid JavaScript's [semicolon insertion](#SemicolonInsertion) issues - i.e `if (a) { ...`
	* Use line comments `//comment` and not block commenting (unless you're _commenting out_ code)
	* Declare all your variables at the **beginning of the function**, due to JavaScript's functional scope
> I use a single global variable to contain an application or library. Every object has its own namespace, so it is easy to use objects to organize my code. Use of closure provides further information hiding, increasing the strength of my modules.


## <a name="chapter10"/> Chapter 10 - Beautiful Features

Each feature you add to something has a lot of different costs (documentation costs, specification, design, testing and development costs) and these are often not properly accounted for.
> Features that offer value to a minority of users impose a cost on all users

> We cope with the complexity of feature-driven design by finding and sticking with the good parts. For example, microwaves do a ton of different things, but most people just use one setting, the timer and the clock. So why not design with just the good parts?


## <a name="AppendixA"/> Appendix A - the Awful Parts

**Need to know what all the pitfalls are with these parts.**

### Global variables
These are variables that are visible throughout the code in any scope. They can be **changed at any time** by any part of the program which makes them **unreliable in larger complex programs**. This can also lead to naming conflicts which can cause your code to fail or you to accidentally overwrite a global variable.

Defined in three ways:
* Using a `var` statement **outside** of any function; `var foo = value`;
* By adding a property to the global object (container of all global variables), such as `window` in browsers; `window.foo = value;`
* Using a variable without declaring it with `var`, which makes it an _implied global_; `foo = value`

### Scope
Although JavaScript has block _syntax_ (i.e. is written in blocks) like a lot of other programming languages, it has **functional scope** and _not_ block scope.

Variables should all be declared at the top of the function and not littered throughout the block.

### <a name="SemicolonInsertion"/> Semicolon Insertion
Attempts to correct faulty programs by automatically inserting semicolons. **Do not depend on this** as it can hide underlying issues.

Also ensure opening curly braces ({) are on the first line of a statement, otherwise semicolons will be erroneously inserted and cause problems:
```javascript
//Ensure curly braces open on the first line of a statement
return {
	status: true	//for example
};
//instead of
return
{
	status:true
};
```
### Reserved Words
Most JavaScript reserved words are not used in the language but **cannot be used to name variables or parameters**.

If used as the key in object literals, they _must_ be quoted. For example `object - {'case' : value};` or `object['final'] = value;` as _case_ and _final_ are both reserved words.

### Unicode
JavaScript characters are 16 bits which only cover the original Unicode Basic Multilingual Place.

### typeof
Watch out for:
* `typeof null` which returns 'object' instead of 'null'
* incorrect reporting on typeof regular expressions, with some implementations returning 'object' and some returning 'function'
* arrays are objects in JavaScript so `typeof array` will return 'object'

All `object`s are _truthy_ and `null` is _falsy_, so you can use the following to tell them apart:
```javascript
if (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object') {
	//then my value is definitely an object or an array because not only is its 'typeof' an object but it's also truthy (first statement)
}
```

### NaN
* `typeof NaN === 'number'` even though it stands for _not-a-number_
* If you have a chain of formulas that together produce a `NaN` then at least _one_ of them will have generated `NaN`
* Surprisingly `NaN !=== NaN`
* `isNaN(value)` can be used to distinguish numbers from NaN

For numbers, best use your own isNumber formula:
```javascript
var isNumber = function isNumber(value) {
	return typeof value === 'number' && isFinite(value);	//isFinite() rejects NaN and Infinity, but is only good for numbers, not strings
}
```

### Phony Arrays
JavaScript **doesn't have real arrays**, it has _array-like objects_.

* Good: No need to give them dimensions and don't generate out-of-bounds errors
* Bad: Slower than 'real' arrays

To test if value is an array:
```javascript
if (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object' && typeof my_value.length === 'number' &&
	!(my_value.propertyIsEnumerable('length'))) {
		//my_value is definitely an array!
}
```
The `arguments` array isn't an array, just an object with a length property.

### Falsy Values
`0`, `NaN`, `''`, `false`, `null` and `undefined` are all _falsy_ values, but **they are not interchangeable**. When testing for a missing member of an object for example, you need to use `undefined` and not `null`.

`undefined` and `NaN` are actually global variables instead of constants but **don't change their values**.

### Object
JavaScript objects inherit members from the prototype chain so they are _never truly empty_.

To test for membership without prototype chain involvement, use the `hasOwnProperty` method or limit your results (for example, to specific types like number so you know you're not dragging in object members from up the prototype for example if that's what's causing the problem).

## <a name="AppendixB"/> Appendix B - the Bad Parts

**Avoid these altogether**

* `==` **and** `!=`: Don't function properly when result is false, use `===` or `!==` instead
* `with` **statement**: Intended to provide a shortcut to properties of an object but results vary every time it is run
* `eval`: Adds unnecessary complication and compromises the security of the application
	* Giving string arguments to `setTimeout` and `setInterval` should also be avoided as this makes them act like `eval`
* `continue` **statement**: Forces a loop into its next iteration but the code is usually much improved when re-written _without_ `continue`
* `switch` **fall through**: In a `switch` statement, each `case` falls through to the next `case` unless you explicitly disrupt the flow, but using these _intentional_ fall throughs makes the _unintentional_ ones that are causing errors basically impossible to find
	* This is one of those parts of JavaScript that appears useful but you're better off avoiding because it's occasionally very dangerous
* **Block-less statements**: _Always_ use curly braces `{}` to block in statements so as to avoid misinterpretation and aid error finding
* **Bitwise operators**: Shouldn't really be doing this kind of manipulations because they are quite slow in JavaScript, therefore there shouldn't be a need to use `&`, `|`, `ˆ`, `˜`, `>>`, `>>>` or `<<`
	* This doesn't mean you can't use `&&` for example
* `++` **and** `--`: This one seems debatable to me; Douglas Crockford finds it makes his coding style much more cryptic and difficult to read (the book uses `+=1` and `-=1` instead)

**The function statement vs the function expression:**
To use JavaScript well, important to understand that **functions are values**.
* A function _statement_ is shorthand for a var statement with a function value, so `function foo() {}` (a function statement) means pretty much the same as `var foo = function foo(){};` (a function expression)
* Logically, to write the language well you should define a function before using it, but in JavaScript, function statements (using just `function foo(){}`) are _hoisted_ to the top of the scope in which they are defined - this encourages sloppy programming and should be avoided
* function statements also don't function consistently in `if` statements
* if you need to start a function expression with the word _function_, **wrap it in parentheses** (), or JavaScript assumes it's a function _statement_

**Typed wrappers:**
**Don't use `new Boolean` or `new String` or `new Number`**, it's completely unnecessary. Also avoid `new Object` and `new Array` and use `{}` and `[]` instead.

**<a name="new"/>`new` operator:**
Functions that are intended to be used with `new` (conventionally starting with a capital letter) should be avoided (don't define them) as they can cause all kinds of issues and complex bugs which are difficult to catch.

**void**:
In JavaScript, this actually _takes_ a value and _returns_ `undefined`, which is hugely confusing and not helpful. **Don't use it**.


## <a name="AppendixC"/> Appendix C - JSLint

JSLint is a **code quality tool** for JavaScript which checks your syntax.

Having read through this appendix (you can read more about [JSLint here](http://www.jslint.com)), I tend more towards [**_JSHint_**](http://jshint.com/about/), a _fork_ of JSLint. It allows programmers to customise for themselves which the good parts and bad parts are and define their own subset, although naturally there are a number of pre-defined options. [This is a really fantastic article on using JSHint](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-jshint); it's simple and aimed at having you using JSHint in a few minutes as well as providing various sources for pre-defined subsets.

## Installation

1. Install Postgres and a simple UI 

    ```bash
    brew install postgresql
    # https://youtu.be/xaWlS9HtWYw?list=PL-osiE80TeTsKOdPrKeSOp4rN3mza8VHN&t=192
    brew cask install psequel 
    ```

2. Start Postgres
    ```bash
    brew services start postgresql
    ```

3. Initialize the database
    ```bash
    createdb sample_db
    psql sample_db 
    ```

## Creating the first table
https://youtu.be/w4HEVY_GjqY?list=PL-osiE80TeTsKOdPrKeSOp4rN3mza8VHN&t=317

[Postgres Dataype Table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype.html#DATATYPE-TABLE)

```sql
VARCHAR(N) /*Where n is maximum amount of characters that will be stored in the field*/
```

## Delete a table
```sql
DROP TABLE people
```

## Populate data
https://youtu.be/fA0jpjwi4J8?list=PL-osiE80TeTsKOdPrKeSOp4rN3mza8VHN

It is possible to insert data with or without fieldnames.

```sql
INSERT INTO people VALUES (3, 'Dave')
INSERT INTO people (id, name) VALUES (3, 'Dave')
```

## SELECT DATA
https://youtu.be/-FPVPcq28r4?list=PL-osiE80TeTsKOdPrKeSOp4rN3mza8VHN&t=68


### Get all data
```sql
SELECT * from poeple
```

### Get specific columns
```sql
SELECT first_name, age from poeple
```

### Multiple condition where statement
```sql
SELECT * FROM PEOPLEs
WHERE last_name = 'Backstrom'
AND age < 37
```

### ORDER BY

```sql
SELECT * FROM PEOPLE
WHERE age < 35
ORDER BY age;
```

The order will be ascending by default. To revert the order add the ```DESC``` keyword at the end 
of the ```ORDER BY``` statement, like so: 
```sql
SELECT * FROM PEOPLE
WHERE age < 35
ORDER BY age DESC;
```


SELECT * FROM PEOPLE
WHERE age < 35
ORDER BY Last_name, first_name;

### Update
```sql
UPDATE people
SET age=37
WHERE first_name = 'Joakim'
```

### DELETE
```sql
DELETE FROM people
WHERE first_name = 'Joakim'
```

Here is a safe way:

grep -lrIZ foo . | xargs -0 rm -f --
-l prints file names of files matching the search pattern.
-r performs a recursive search for the pattern foo in the given directory ..  If this doesn't work, try -R.
-I (capital i) causes binary files like PDFs to be skipped.
-Z ensures that file names are zero- (i.e., nul-)terminated so that a name containing white space does not get interpreted in the wrong way (i.e., as multiple names instead of one).
xargs -0 feeds the file names from grep to rm -f, separating words by zero (nul) bytes (remember the -Z option from grep).
-- is often forgotten but it is very important to mark the end of options and allow for removal of files whose names begin with -.
If you would like to see which files are about to be deleted, simply remove the | xargs -0 rm -f -- part, and leave off the Z option to grep.

### [_CONTAINER/altwebdevsetup/alt-web-dev-setup.md](_CONTAINER/altwebdevsetup/alt-web-dev-setup.md)


Being a developer isn't just hacking away into the wee hours of the morning or debugging a new feature. In order to become a well-rounded developer we should also understand what tools we need and a minimum understanding of how they work. This includes setting up our computers for development.

Here at App Academy we work with a Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, Redux, and PostgresSQL stack. A [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) is simply a collection of software and hardware used in development of an application. For our specific purposes we are using Ruby on Rails on the backend/server, PostgresSQL to house our database, and JavaScript + React + Redux for frontend rendering and logic.

As we progress through the course you will be prompted to complete a few installation and configuration steps to get your personal machine ready for the next phase.

## Phase 0: Preparing your machine

Here we will install basic developer tools, such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a 3rd party package manager for MacOS), Xcode (a library of developer tools provided by Apple), git (a version control system we will be using throughout the course), and VS Code (a full-featured text-editor).

### Chrome

Here at App Academy, our browser of choice is Google Chrome. This isn't super important at the beginning of the course, but once we get into frontend development the Chrome Devtools (think frontend debugging) are going to play a very important role.

To install, download from the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) and install.

#### Optional for In Person Students App Academy Chrome Tab

We have a custom Chrome Extension for new tabs that provides a dashboard with links to the curriculum, relevant documentation, and, once your cohort starts, links to the day's projects, readings, and homework.

This is not required, but feel free to give it a try. To install, follow the installation instructions on the [App Academy Chrome Tab Repo](https://github.com/appacademy/app-academy-chrome-tab).

### Xcode

Let's start with Xcode. The Xcode command line tools are a requirement for installing the homebrew package manager in the next step.

**NOTE: If you are using a Linux machine you will not be able to install Xcode or homebrew. Instead please follow [these git installation directions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and then [these rbenv installation directions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#basic-github-checkout) (up to and including "Installing Ruby versions") to download rbenv using git. Once you are finished, skip to the section on Git and ignore all commands involving homebrew.**

Install the Xcode command line tools by running the following from the console.

    $ xcode-select --install

To conclude the installation you will need to agree to the Xcode license. Start the Xcode app, click "Agree", and allow the installation to finish. Then you can go ahead and quit the Xcode app.

### Homebrew

Homebrew is kind of like a low-tech App Store. It allows us access to and the ability to install a wide variety of software and command line tools from the console. These are distinct from those hosted on the App Store and will need to be managed by Homebrew.

Enter the following in your terminal to download and install Homebrew:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You will be given a list of dependencies that will be installed and prompted to continue or abort. Press `RETURN` to continue.

Let's break this command down a bit. `curl`, a command-line tool commonly used for downloading files from the internet, is used to download the Homebrew installation file. The `"$(...)"` transforms the file content into a string. Finally, the string is passed to our Ruby executable (`/usr/bin/ruby` is where this the system Ruby executable file is stored on our machine) with the `-e` flag to tell Ruby to run the argument as code.

Check out the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) to learn the basic commands.

### Git

Git is a version control system that allows us to track, commit and revert changes to files within a directory. Here we will install it and add global user info.

    # install git
    brew install git

    # makes git terminal output pretty
    git config --global color.ui true

    # this will mark you as the 'author' of each committed change
    git config --global user.name "your name here"

    # use the email associated with your GitHub account
    git config --global user.email your_email_here

### VS Code

This one is pretty easy. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then download and install VS Code.

To verify that the shell commands were installed correctly, run `which code` in your terminal. If `code` is not a recognized command, open the VS Code editor, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS ,`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux) and type `shell command` to find the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command. Then restart the terminal. This allows you to easily open files in VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command followed by a file or directory.

Next, we'll want to install a few useful VS Code extensions and configure VS Code to play nice with these extensions. Download [this zip file](https://assets.aaonline.io/fullstack/setup_vscode_master.zip), which contains a scripts that will do the work for you. Unzip the file and open the `setup_vscode` directory. Then open that directory in the terminal (drag and drop it over the terminal icon on macOS or right click in the directory and select `Open in Terminal` on most Linux distributions). To run the script, type `./setup_vscode.sh`. The script will do the rest. Simply restart VS Code and you'll be good to go. (Note that there's a second script, called `setup_vscode_linter.sh`. We can't run this script yet but will do so in due time.)

## Phase 1: Ruby

Here we will be setting up Ruby with the help of [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), a Ruby environment manager. We like rbenv because it allows us to switch between versions of Ruby easily and setup default versions to use within project directories. This will install instances of Ruby in addition to the system version, which comes pre-installed.

### Rbenv + Ruby

First we will install rbenv, then use it to install our desired version of Ruby.

    # install rbenv
    brew install rbenv

    # add to the PATH (rbenv commands are now available from terminal)
    # .bashrc is the file that contains all of our terminal settings
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # initialize rbenv everytime you open a new console window (otherwise our system ruby version will take over when we start a new terminal session)
    echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc

    # update current console window with new settings
    source ~/.bashrc

    # source .bashrc from .bash_profile (necessary on some machines)
    echo 'source ~/.bashrc' >> ~/.bash_profile

    # install Ruby version 2.5.1
    rbenv install 2.5.1

    # set version 2.5.1 to be our global default
    rbenv global 2.5.1

    # the 'rehash' command updates the environment to your configuration
    rbenv rehash

    # and let's verify everything is correct
    # check the version
    ruby -v # => 2.5.1

    # check that we are using rbenv (this tells you where the version of ruby you are using is installed)
    which ruby # => /Users/your-username/.rbenv/shims/ruby

### Gems

There are a few gems we will want to access globally.

- Bundler allows us to define project dependencies inside a `Gemfile` and gives us a bunch of commands to update, remove and install them. Check out the [Bundler docs](http://bundler.io/docs.html) for more info.
- Pry is an alternative to the Irb (the default Ruby REPL). It is not only more powerful, but also easier to use than Irb and should be your go-to for running and debugging Ruby code. Check out the [Pry website](http://pryrepl.org/) for more info and a super useful tutorial.
- Byebug is feature-rich debugging tool for Ruby. With Byebug you can halt the execution of your code and inspect/track variables and the flow of execution. Lots of cool features in here, so check out the [Byebug docs](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug)!

Let's install them.

    gem install bundler pry byebug

## Phase 2: Backend Development

For backend development we will need a database application, a server, and a web-application framework.

For the purposes of this course, we will be using two database applications: PostgreSQL and SQLite.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a fast, feature-rich, open-source database application. It is a scalable application that we can use for development and production apps. We will be using PostgreSQL for most of our web-apps.

#### MacOS X

Fortunately for MacOS X, we can use [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/), which provides the database application and a command line interface (CLI) so we can interact with it. To install Postgres.app, download and follow the installation instructions from the website.

**Though the instructions say it is optional, it is highly recommended to configure your system `$PATH` so that you can use the command line tools.** We will make extensive use of them in the course.

Paste these commands into the terminal:

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/paths.d &&
    echo /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin | sudo tee /etc/paths.d/postgresapp

#### Linux

The [Ubuntu wiki](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) can help. See especially "Alternative Server Setup".

### After installation

Close and reopen your terminal to gain access to the `psql` command. Let's try it out.

    # open the PostgreSQL CLI
    psql

    # you should be greeted with a prompt that looks like this
    psql (10.X)
    Type "help" for help.

    yourname=#

    # type '/q' to quit
    yourname=# \q

**NB: You do not need a graphical client for this course. We encourage you to use the CLI as it teaches you the hard way and is the most common way to interact with a database directly.**

### SQLite

[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html) is a small, lightweight database application that requires no configuration and stores the database as a stand-alone file. For this reason, we will be using SQLite for a few of our in-class projects.

Install using the Brew package manager:

    brew install sqlite

Again, verify that installation was successful by opening the SQLite CLI.

    # open SQLite CLI with this command
    sqlite3

    #  you should see this output
    # SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39
    # Enter ".help" for usage hints.
    # Connected to a transient in-memory database.
    # Use ".open FILENAME" to reopen on a persistent database.

    # .q to quit
    sqlite> .q

### Rails

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) will serve as our application framework for this course. Rails is a very full-featured, opinionated framework that provides all the tools we need to create a complete web-app. These include an ORM (Object Relational Mapper - essentially we can continue to use Object Oriented Programming with respect to resources in our database), routing, a development server, and a templating engine.

Fortunately for us, Rails is available as a gem in the Ruby ecosystem. Let's install it, specifying the version so that we're all working in sync:

    # install rails
    gem install rails --version 5.2.3
    rbenv rehash
    # verify installation
    which rails # => /Users/username/.rbenv/shims/rails

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### Node.js & NPM

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) will be our local JavaScript engine. This is used to run JavaScript code and run associated node commands.

Again, we want to use a version manager with Node to help us manage potential conflicts between versions and dependencies. In this case we will be using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to install/manage Node.js.

    # download and run the official install script
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash

    # update your terminal config (you will now have access to the nvm command)
    source ~/.bashrc

    # install a stable version of node
    nvm install 10.13.0

    # set version 10.13.0 as default version
    nvm use 10.13.0

    # verify install/config
    which node # => /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v10.13.0/bin/node

Node, like Ruby, comes with a package manager called [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), which provides access to a whole ecosystem of libraries and tools we can use. NPM comes pre-bundled with Node, so there is no additional work for us to do. By default we don't need any additional packages installed and will be installing them on a per-project basis.

#SORTS
- Selection Sort: This algorithm works by examining a contiguous sublist of the original list. It finds the nth largest element in the list and swaps it with the nth element. It then examines n-1 terms. Selection sort runs in Θ(n2) time for worst, bets, and average case scenarios.
- Bubblesort: This algorithm works by swapping consecutive elements that are unordered. It ex- amines two consecutive elements at a time. Bubblesort terminates when it completes an iteration through the list without swapping any elements. It runs in O(n2) time for average and worst cases, and O(n) time if the list is already sorted.
- Insertion Sort: This algorithm works by examining a larger contiguous subset of the original list on each iteration. On the first iteration, only elements at indices 0-1 are examined. If they are out of order, they are swapped. On the next iteration, elements at indices 0-2 are examined. The element at index 2 is pulled out of the list and compared against the preceding one-by-one while it is bigger than the given element. This process is repeated throughout the entire list. If the list is nearly sorted, then insertion sort runs in O(n) time. Otherwise, it runs in O(n2) time.
- Mergesort: This algorithm partitions the list into contiguous sublists until each sublist has at most two elements. These elements are swapped if necessary. The sublists are then merged into their parent sublists such that the elements are properly ordered. Mergesort runs in O(nlog(n)) time, and is an ideal sorting algorithm for both arrays and linked lists.
- Quicksort: This algorithm works to sort arrays by ordering elements around a partition point. Elements larger than the parttion go to the right of it, and elements smaller than the partition go to the left of it. Elements equal to the partition value can be placed on either side, as long as this is handled consistently. The subsets on either side of the partition are then recursively
6
evaluated until contiguous subsets of no more than two elements are evaluated.

# Sample implementation of quicksort and mergesort in ruby
Both algorithm sort in O(n * lg(n)) time
Quicksort works inplace, where mergesort works in a new array

```ruby
def quicksort(array, from=0, to=nil)
    if to == nil
        # Sort the whole array, by default
        to = array.count - 1
    end
 
    if from >= to
        # Done sorting
        return
    end
 
    # Take a pivot value, at the far left
    pivot = array[from]
 
    # Min and Max pointers
    min = from
    max = to
 
    # Current free slot
    free = min
 
    while min < max
        if free == min # Evaluate array[max]
            if array[max] <= pivot # Smaller than pivot, must move
                array[free] = array[max]
                min += 1
                free = max
            else
                max -= 1
            end
        elsif free == max # Evaluate array[min]
            if array[min] >= pivot # Bigger than pivot, must move
                array[free] = array[min]
                max -= 1
                free = min
            else
                min += 1

            raise "Inconsistent state"
        end
    end
 
    array[free] = pivot
 
    quicksort array, from, free - 1
    quicksort array, free + 1, to

#What Happens When You Type In A URL
```

browser checks cache; if requested object is in cache and is fresh, skip to #9
browser asks OS for server's IP address
OS makes a DNS lookup and replies the IP address to the browser
browser opens a TCP connection to server (this step is much more complex with HTTPS)
browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection
browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request
browser checks if the response is a redirect (3xx result status codes), authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal responses (2xx)
if cacheable, response is stored in cache
browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped)
browser determines what to do with response (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an image, is it a sound clip?)
browser renders response, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types

# **Notes**

## **Big O**

```js
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 1) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

## **Big O Notation**

- Big O helps gives us a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs.

  - Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches.
  - Helps us debug things easier.
  - It also comes up a lot in interviews!

- An Example: Comparing two functions that calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 up to n.

```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}
```

> Number of operations will grow with n.
> Would be O(n) or Linear Time.

```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  return (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
}
```

> Has three simple operations: 1 Multiplication 1 Addition 1 Division. (Regardless of n)
> Would be O(1) or Constant Time.

- First we need to consider what makes one implementation better than the other?

  - Faster? (Time Complexity);
  - Less Memory Intensive (Space Complexity);
  - More Readable

- How can we measure speed?

  - Timers? (Doesn't work well - not reliable or precise)
  - Instead we should count the number of simple operations.

- Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting.
- An algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant f(n) times, as n increases.
  - f(n) = n (Linear)
  - f(n) = n^2 (Quadratic)
  - f(n) = 1 (Constant)
  - f(n) could be anything!

```js
function countUpAndDown(n) {
  console.log('going up!');
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log('at the top, going down!');
  for (let j = n - 1; j >=0; j--) {
    console.log(j);
  }
  console.log('Back down, bye!);
}
```

> Both loops are O(n) but since we just want the big picture, this entire function would be O(n);

```js
function printAllPairs(n) {
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
      console.log(i, j);
    }
  }
}
```

> Nested loops are never a good thing when trying to write fast code.
> O(n^2) or Quadratic Time.

- Constants don't matter in big O & Smaller Terms don't matter

  - O(2n) is just O(n) Linear
  - O(500) is just O(1) Constnat
  - O(13n^2) is just O(n^2) Quadratic
  - O(n + 10) is just O(n) Linear
  - O(1000n + 50) is just O(n) Linear
  - O(n^2 + 5n + 8) is just O(n^2) Quadratic

- **`Big O Shorthands`**

  - Arithmetic Operations are Constant
  - Variable assignment is constant
  - Accessing elements in an array (by index) or by object (by key) is constant.
  - In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever is inside of the loop.

- Additional Examples

```js
function logAtLeast5(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.max(5, n); i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

> O(n) Linear Time

```js
function logAtMost5(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.min(5, n); i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

> O(1) Constant Time.

## **A Guide to Big-O Notation**

**Curating Complexity: A Guide to Big-O Notation**

- Why is looking at runtime not a reliable method of calculating time complexity?

  - Not all computers are made equal( some may be stronger and therefore boost our runtime speed )
  - How many background processes ran concurrently with our program that was being tested?
  - We also need to ask if our code remains performant if we increase the size of the input.

- The real question we need to answering is: **`How does our performance scale?`**.

**Big O Notation**

- Big O Notation is a tool for describing the efficiency of algorithms with respect to the size of the input arguments.
- Since we use mathematical functions in Big-O, there are a few big picture ideas that we'll want to keep in mind:
  - The function should be defined by the size of the input.
  - **`Smaller`** Big O is better (lower time complexity)
  - Big O is used to describe the worst case scenario.
  - Big O is simplified to show only its most dominant mathematical term.

**Simplifying Math Terms**

- We can use the following rules to simplify the our Big O functions:

  - **`Simplify Products`** : If the function is a product of many terms, we drop the terms that don't depend on n.
  - **`Simplify Sums`** : If the function is a sum of many terms, we drop the non-dominant terms.

- **`n`** : size of the input
- **`T(f)`** : unsimplified math function
- **`O(f)`** : simplified math function.

**`Simplifying a Product`**
| Unsimplified        | Big-O Simplified      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- |
| T(5 _ n^2)          | O(n^2) Quadratic      |
| T(100000 _ n)       | O(n) Linear           |
| T( n / 12)          | O (n) Linear          |
| T( 42 _ n _ log(n)) | O(nlog(n)) Log Linear |
| T(12)               | O(1) Constant         |

**`Simplifying a Sum`**
| Unsimplified     | Big-O Simplified   |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| T( n3 + n2 + n ) | O(n^3)             |
| T( log(n) + 2n ) | O(2^n) Exponential |
| T( n + log(n) )  | O(n) Linear        |
| T( n! + 10n )    | O(n!) Polynomial   |

**`Putting it all together`**

| Unsimplified      | Big-O Simplified      |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| T( 5n2 + 99n )    | O(n^2) Quadratic      |
| T( 2n + nlog(n) ) | O(nlog(n)) Log Linear |
| T( 2n + 5n1000)   | O(2^n) Exponential    |

- First we apply the product rule to drop all constants.
- Then we apply the sum rule to select the single most dominant term.

## **Complexity Classes**

**Common Complexity Classes**

> There are 7 major classes in Time Complexity

| Big O                      | Complexity Class Name                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| O(1)                       | Constant                               |
| O(log(n))                  | Logarithmic                            |
| O(n)                       | Linear                                 |
| O(nlog(n))                 | Loglinear, Linearithmetic, Quasilinear |
| O(nc) - O(n2), O(n3), etc. | Polynomial                             |
| O(cn) - O(2n), O(3n), etc. | Exponential                            |
| O(n!)                      | Factorial                              |

- **`O(1) Constant`**

  - The algorithm takes roughly the same number of steps for any input size.

  ```js
  // O(1)
  function constant1(n) {
    return n * 2 + 1;
  }

  // O(1)
  function constant2(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
  ```

- **`O(log(n)) Logarithmic`**

  - In most cases our hidden base of Logarithmic time is 2, log complexity algo's will typically display 'halving' the size of the input (like binary search!)

  ```js
  // O(log(n))
  function logarithmic1(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return;
    logarithmic1(n / 2);
  }

  // O(log(n))
  function logarithmic2(n) {
    let i = n;
    while (i > 1) {
      i /= 2;
    }
  }
  ```

- **`O(n) Linear`**

  - Linear algo's will access each item of the input "once".

  ```js
  // O(n)
  function linear1(n) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }

  // O(n), where n is the length of the array
  function linear2(array) {
    for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }

  // O(n)
  function linear3(n) {
    if (n === 1) return;
    linear3(n - 1);
  }
  ```

- **`O(nlog(n)) Log Linear Time`**
  - Combination of linear and logarithmic behavior, we will see features from both classes.
  - Algo's that are log-linear will use both recursion AND iteration.

```js
// O(n * log(n))
function loglinear(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return;

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  loglinear(n / 2);
  loglinear(n / 2);
}
```

- **`O(nc) Polynomial`**
  - C is a fixed constant.

```js
// O(n^2)
function quadratic(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {}
  }
}

// O(n^3)
function cubic(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      for (let k = 1; k <= n; k++) {}
    }
  }
}
```

- Example of Quadratic and Cubic runtime.

- **`O(c^n) Exponential`**
  - C is now the number of recursive calls made in each stack frame.
  - Algo's with exponential time are VERY SLOW.

```js
// O(2^n)
function exponential2n(n) {
  if (n === 1) return;
  exponential_2n(n - 1);
  exponential_2n(n - 1);
}

// O(3^n)
function exponential3n(n) {
  if (n === 0) return;
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
  exponential_3n(n - 1);
}
```

- **`O(n!) Factorial`**
  - The largest/ worst complexity (minus DTIME which is n^n);

---

## **Memoization**

- **Memoization** : a design pattern used to reduce the overall number of calculations that can occur in algorithms that use recursive strategies to solve.
  - MZ stores the results of the sub-problems in some other data structure, so that we can avoid duplicate calculations and only 'solve' each problem once.
  - Two features that comprise memoization:
    - 1. FUNCTION MUST BE RECURSIVE.
    - 2. Our additional DS is usually an object (we refer to it as our memo!)

**Memoizing Factorial**

```js
let memo = {};

function factorial(n) {
  // if this function has calculated factorial(n) previously,
  // fetch the stored result in memo
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n === 1) return 1;

  // otherwise, it havs not calculated factorial(n) previously,
  // so calculate it now, but store the result in case it is
  // needed again in the future
  memo[n] = n * factorial(n - 1);
  return memo[n];
}

factorial(6); // => 720, requires 6 calls
factorial(6); // => 720, requires 1 call
factorial(5); // => 120, requires 1 call
factorial(7); // => 5040, requires 2 calls

memo; // => { '2': 2, '3': 6, '4': 24, '5': 120, '6': 720, '7': 5040 }
```

- Our memo object is _mapping_ out our arguments of factorial to it's return value.
  - Keep in mind we didn't improve the speed of our algo.

**Memoizing Fibonacci**
![memofib](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/memoization/images/fib_memoized.png)

- Our time complexity for fibonacci goes from O(2^n) to O(n) after applying memoization.

**The Memoization Formula**

> Rules

1. Write the unoptimized brute force recursion (make sure it works);
2. Add memo object as an additional arugmnt .
3. Add a base case condition that returns the stored value if the function's argument is in the memo.
4. Before returning the result of the recursive case, store it in the memo as a value and make the function's argument it's key.

> Things to remember

1. When solving DP problems with Memoization, it is helpful to draw out the visual tree first.
2. When you notice duplicate sub-tree's that means we can memoize.

---

## \*\*

```js
function fastFib(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];
  if (n === 1 || n === 2) return 1;

  memo[n] = fastFib(n - 1, memo) + fastFib(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

fastFib(6); // => 8
fastFib(50); // => 12586269025
```

---

## **Tabulation**

- **Tabulation Strategy**
  - Use When:
    - The function is iterative and not recursive.
    - The accompanying DS is usually an array.

```js
function fib(n) {
  let mostRecentCalcs = [0, 1];

  if (n === 0) return mostRecentCalcs[0];

  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    const [secondLast, last] = mostRecentCalcs;
    mostRecentCalcs = [last, secondLast + last];
  }

  return mostRecentCalcs[1];
}
```

- Steps for tabulation
  - Create a table array based off the size of the input.
  - Initialize some values in the table to 'answer' the trivially small subproblem.
  - Iterate through the array and fill in the remaining entries.
  - Your final answer is usually the last entry in the table.

# **Memo and Tab Demo with Fibonacci**

```js
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

> Normal Recursive Fibonacci

```js
function fibMemo(n, memo = { 0: 0, 1: 1 }) {
  if (n in memo) return memo[n];

  memo[n] = fibMemo(n - 1) + fibMemo(n - 2);
  return memo[n];
}
```

> Memoization Fibonacci 1

```js
function fib(n, memo) {
  memo = memo || {};

  if (memo[n]) return memo[n];
  if (n <= 2) return 1;
  return (memo[n] = fib(n - 1, memo) + fib(n - 2, memo));
}
```

> Memoization Fibonacci 2

```js
function tabFib(n) {
  let table = new Array(n);

  table[0] = 0;
  table[1] = 1;
  table[2] = 1;

  for (i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    table[i] = table[i - 1] + table[i - 2];
    console.log(table);
  }

  return table[n];
}
```

# **Class Examples**

## **Example of Linear Search**

```js
function search(array, term) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] === term) {
      return i;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

- Worst Case Scenario: The term does not even exist in the array.
- Meaning: If it doesn't exist then our for loop would run until the end therefore making our time complexity O(n).

## **Example of Binary Search**

```js
function binarySearch(arr, x, start, end) {
  if (start > end) return false;

  let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
  if (arr[mid] === x) return true;

  if (arr[mid] > x) {
    return binarySearch(arr, x, start, mid - 1);
  } else {
    return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, end);
  }
}
```

- Must be conducted on a sorted array.
- Binary search is logarithmic time, not exponential b/c n is cut down by two, not growing.
- Binary Search is part of Divide and Conquer.

## **Example of Merge Sort**

```js
function merge(leftArray, rightArray) {
  const sorted = [];
  while (letArray.length > 0 && rightArray.length > 0) {
    const leftItem = leftArray[0];
    const rightItem = rightArray[0];

    if (leftItem > rightItem) {
      sorted.push(rightItem);
      rightArray.shift();
    } else {
      sorted.push(leftItem);
      leftArray.shift();
    }
  }

  while (leftArray.length !== 0) {
    const value = leftArray.shift();
    sorted.push(value);
  }

  while (rightArray.length !== 0) {
    const value = rightArray.shift();
    sorted.push(value);
  }

  return sorted;
}

function mergeSort(array) {
  const length = array.length;
  if (length === 1) {
    return array;
  }

  const middleIndex = Math.ceil(length / 2);
  const leftArray = array.slice(0, middleIndex);
  const rightArray = array.slice(middleIndex, length);

  leftArray = mergeSort(leftArray);
  rightArray = mergeSort(rightArray);

  return merge(leftArray, rightArray);
}
```

---

## **Example of Bubble Sort**

```js
function bubbleSort(items) {
  let length = items.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < length - i - 1; j++) {
      if (items[j] > items[j + 1]) {
        let tmp = items[j];
        items[j] = items[j + 1];
        items[j + 1] = tmp;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Worst Case & Best Case are always the same because it makes nested loops.
- Double for loops are polynomial time complexity or more specifically in this case Quadratic big O O(n^2);
# **Notes**

## **Sorting Algorithms**

## **Bubble Sort**

- The first major sorting algorithm one learns in introductory programming courses.
- Gives an intro on how to convert unsorted data into sorted data.
- It's almost never used in production code because:
  - It's not efficient
  - It's not commonly used
  - There is stigma attached to it
- **`Bubbling Up`** : Term that infers that an item _is in motion_, _moving in some direction_, and _has some final resting destination_.

- Bubble sort, sorts an array of integers by bubbling the largest integer to the top.
  ![bubble](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/naive_sorting_algorithms/bubble_sort/images/BubbleSort.gif)

```js
// Bubble Sort
function bubble(array) {
  let sorted = true;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    let num1 = array[i];
    let num2 = array[i + 1];
    if (num1 > num2) {
      array[i + 1] = num1;
      array[i] = num2;
      sorted = false;
    }
  }
  if (sorted) {
    return array;
  } else {
    return bubble(array);
  }
}
```

## **Selection Sort**

- Selection sort organizes the smallest elements to the start of the array.
  ![selection](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/naive_sorting_algorithms/selection_sort/images/SelectionSort.gif)
- Summary of how Selection Sort should work:
  1. Set MIN to location 0
  2. Search the minimum element in the list.
  3. Swap with value at location Min
  4. Increment Min to point to next element.
  5. Repeat until list is sorted.

```js
let selectionSort = (arr) => {
  let len = arr.length;
  for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    let min = i;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
      if (arr[min] > arr[j]) {
        min = j;
      }
    }
    if (min !== i) {
      let tmp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[min];
      arr[min] = tmp;
    }
  }
  return arr;
};
```

# **Sorting Algorithms**

## **Bubble Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- The inner for-loop contributes to O(n), however in a worst case scenario the while loop will need to run n times before bringing all n elements to their final resting spot.

**`Space Complexity`**: O(1)

- Bubble Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

## **Selection Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n^2);

**`Space Complexity`**: O(1)

- Selection Sort will always use the same amount of memory regardless of n.

## **Insertion Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Our outer loop will contribute O(n) while the inner loop will contribute O(n / 2) on average. Because our loops are nested we will get O(n^2);

**`Space Complexity`**: O(n)

- Because we are creating a subArray for each element in the original input, our Space Comlexity becomes linear.

      j--;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = current;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

---

## **Merge Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Log Linear O(nlog(n))

- Since our array gets split in half every single time we contribute O(log(n)). The while loop contained in our helper merge function contributes O(n) therefore our time complexity is O(nlog(n));
  **`Space Complexity`**: O(n)
- We are linear O(n) time because we are creating subArrays.

  const left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid));
  const right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

  return merge(left, right);
}
```

## **Quick Sort**

**`Time Complexity`**: Quadratic O(n^2)

- Even though the average time complexity O(nLog(n)), the worst case scenario is always quadratic.

**`Space Complexity`**: O(n)

- Our space complexity is linear O(n) because of the partition arrays we create.

## **Binary Search**

**`Time Complexity`**: Log Time O(log(n))

**`Space Complexity`**: O(1)
![bin](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Binary-Search.png)

> Recursive Solution

```js
function binarySearch(array, target) {
  if (array.length === 0) return false;

  let midPt = Math.floor(array.length / 2);

  if (array[midPt] === target) {
    return true;
  } else if (list[midPt] > target) {
    return binarySearch(list.slice(0, mid), target);
  } else {
    return binarySearch(list.slice(midPt + 1), target);
  }
}
```

> Min Max Solution

```js
function binarySearch(array, target) {
  let start = 0;
  let end = array.length - 1;

  while (start <= end) {
    let midpoint = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

    if (target === array[midpoint]) {
      return midpoint;
    }

    if (target > array[midpoint]) {
      start = midpoint + 1;
    }

    if (target < array[midpoint]) {
      end = midpoint - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

## **Insertion Sort**

![insert](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/naive_sorting_algorithms/insertion_sort/images/InsertionSort.gif)

- Works by building a larger and larger sorted region at the left-most end of the array.
- Steps:
  1. If it is the first element, and it is already sorted; return 1.
  2. Pick next element.
  3. Compare with all elements in the sorted sub list
  4. Shift all the elemnts in the sorted sub list that is greater than the value to be sorted.
  5. Insert the value
  6. Repeat until list is sorted.

```js
let insertionSort = (inputArr) => {
  let length = inputArr.length;
  for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {
    let key = inputArr[i];
    let j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && inputArr[j] > key) {
      inputArr[j + 1] = inputArr[j];
      j = j - 1;
    }
    inputArr[j + 1] = key;
  }
  return inputArr;
};
```

## **Merge Sort**

![merge](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/efficient_sorting_algorithms/merge_sort/images/MergeSort.gif)

- Merge sort is nlogn time.
- We need a function for merging and a function for sorting.
- Steps:
  1. If there is only one element in the list, it is already sorted; return the array.
  2. Otherwise, divide the list recursively into two halves until it can no longer be divided.
  3. Merge the smallest lists into new list in a sorted order.

```js
const merge = (arr1, arr2) => {
  let sorted = [];

  while (arr1.length && arr2.length) {
    if (arr1[0] < arr2[0]) sorted.push(arr1.shift());
    else sorted.push(arr2.shift());
  }

  return sorted.concat(arr1.slice().concat(arr2.slice()));
};
```

```js
const mergeSort = (arr) => {
  if (arr.length <= 1) return arr;
  let mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2),
    left = mergeSort(arr.slice(0, mid)),
    right = mergeSort(arr.slice(mid));

  return merge(left, right);
};
```

---

## **Quick Sort**

- QS is another Divide and Conquer strategy.
- Some key ideas to keep in mind:
  - It is easy to sort elements of an array relative to a particular target value.
  - An array of 0 or 1 elements is already trivially sorted.
    ![quicksort](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/appacademy-open-assets/data_structures_algorithms/efficient_sorting_algorithms/quick_sort/images/QuickSort.gif)

```js
function quick_Sort(origArray) {
  if (origArray.length <= 1) {
    return origArray;
  } else {
    let left = [];
    let right = [];
    let newArray = [];
    let pivot = origArray.pop();
    let length = origArray.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      if (origArray[i] <= pivot) {
        left.push(origArray[i]);
      } else {
        right.push(origArray[i]);
      }
    }

    return newArray.concat(quick_Sort(left), pivot, quick_Sort(right));
  }
}
```

**binary search**

```js
const binarySearch = (array, target) => {
  let startIndex = 0;
  let endIndex = array.length - 1;
  while(startIndex <= endIndex) {
    let middleIndex = Math.floor((startIndex + endIndex) / 2);
    if(target === array[middleIndex) {
      return console.log("Target was found at index " + middleIndex);
    }
    if(target > array[middleIndex]) {
      console.log("Searching the right side of Array")
      startIndex = middleIndex + 1;
    }
    if(target < array[middleIndex]) {
      console.log("Searching the left side of array")
      endIndex = middleIndex - 1;
    }
    else {
      console.log("Not Found this loop iteration. Looping another iteration.")
    }
  }

  console.log("Target value not found in array");
}
```
# **Notes**

## **Linked Lists**

- A **`linked list`** represents a linear sequence of 'vertices' or 'nodes' and tracks three properties.
  - **`Head`** : The first node in the list.
  - **`Tail`** : The last node in the list.
  - **`Length`** : The number of nodes in the list; the list's length.
- **`Nodes`** : Simpler, smaller data structure that connects the linked list.
- Node Properties:
  - **`Value`** : THe actual value this node represents.
  - **`Next`** : The next node in the list (relative to this node).
  - **`Previous`** : The previous node in the list (relative to this node).

# Docker Commands, Help & Tips

### Show commands & management commands

```
$ docker
```

### Docker version info

```
$ docker version
```

### Show info like number of containers, etc

```
$ docker info
```

# WORKING WITH CONTAINERS

### Create an run a container in foreground

```
$ docker container run -it -p 80:80 nginx
```

### Create an run a container in background

```
$ docker container run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

### Shorthand

```
$ docker container run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

### Naming Containers

```
$ docker container run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx-server nginx
```

### TIP: WHAT RUN DID

- Looked for image called nginx in image cache
- If not found in cache, it looks to the default image repo on Dockerhub
- Pulled it down (latest version), stored in the image cache
- Started it in a new container
- We specified to take port 80- on the host and forward to port 80 on the container
- We could do "$ docker container run --publish 8000:80 --detach nginx" to use port 8000
- We can specify versions like "nginx:1.09"

### List running containers

```
$ docker container ls
```

OR

```
$ docker ps
```

### List all containers (Even if not running)

```
$ docker container ls -a
```

### Stop container

```
$ docker container stop [ID]
```

### Stop all running containers

```
$ docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Remove container (Can not remove running containers, must stop first)

```
$ docker container rm [ID]
```

### To remove a running container use force(-f)

```
$ docker container rm -f [ID]
```

### Remove multiple containers

```
$ docker container rm [ID] [ID] [ID]
```

### Remove all containers

```
$ docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

### Get logs (Use name or ID)

```
$ docker container logs [NAME]
```

### List processes running in container

```
$ docker container top [NAME]
```

#### TIP: ABOUT CONTAINERS

Docker containers are often compared to virtual machines but they are actually just processes running on your host os. In Windows/Mac, Docker runs in a mini-VM so to see the processes youll need to connect directly to that. On Linux however you can run "ps aux" and see the processes directly

# IMAGE COMMANDS

### List the images we have pulled

```
$ docker image ls
```

### We can also just pull down images

```
$ docker pull [IMAGE]
```

### Remove image

```
$ docker image rm [IMAGE]
```

### Remove all images

```
$ docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```

#### TIP: ABOUT IMAGES

- Images are app bianaries and dependencies with meta data about the image data and how to run the image
- Images are no a complete OS. No kernel, kernel modules (drivers)
- Host provides the kernel, big difference between VM

### Some sample container creation

NGINX:

```
$ docker container run -d -p 80:80 --name nginx nginx (-p 80:80 is optional as it runs on 80 by default)
```

APACHE:

```
$ docker container run -d -p 8080:80 --name apache httpd
```

MONGODB:

```
$ docker container run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo
```

MYSQL:

```
$ docker container run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mysql --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=123456 mysql
```

## CONTAINER INFO

### View info on container

```
$ docker container inspect [NAME]
```

### Specific property (--format)

```
$ docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' [NAME]
```

### Performance stats (cpu, mem, network, disk, etc)

```
$ docker container stats [NAME]
```

## ACCESSING CONTAINERS

### Create new nginx container and bash into

```
$ docker container run -it --name [NAME] nginx bash
```

- i = interactive Keep STDIN open if not attached
- t = tty - Open prompt

**For Git Bash, use "winpty"**

```
$ winpty docker container run -it --name [NAME] nginx bash
```

### Run/Create Ubuntu container

```
$ docker container run -it --name ubuntu ubuntu
```

**(no bash because ubuntu uses bash by default)**

### You can also make it so when you exit the container does not stay by using the -rm flag

```
$ docker container run --rm -it --name [NAME] ubuntu
```

### Access an already created container, start with -ai

```
$ docker container start -ai ubuntu
```

### Use exec to edit config, etc

```
$ docker container exec -it mysql bash
```

### Alpine is a very small Linux distro good for docker

```
$ docker container run -it alpine sh
```

(use sh because it does not include bash)
(alpine uses apk for its package manager - can install bash if you want)

# NETWORKING

### "bridge" or "docker0" is the default network

### Get port

```
$ docker container port [NAME]
```

### List networks

```
$ docker network ls
```

### Inspect network

```
$ docker network inspect [NETWORK_NAME]
("bridge" is default)
```

### Create network

```
$ docker network create [NETWORK_NAME]
```

### Create container on network

```
$ docker container run -d --name [NAME] --network [NETWORK_NAME] nginx
```

### Connect existing container to network

```
$ docker network connect [NETWORK_NAME] [CONTAINER_NAME]
```

### Disconnect container from network

```
$ docker network disconnect [NETWORK_NAME] [CONTAINER_NAME]
```

### Detach network from container

```
$ docker network disconnect
```

# IMAGE TAGGING & PUSHING TO DOCKERHUB

# tags are labels that point ot an image ID

```
$ docker image ls
```

Youll see that each image has a tag

### Retag existing image

```
$ docker image tag nginx btraversy/nginx
```

### Upload to dockerhub

```
$ docker image push bradtraversy/nginx
```

### If denied, do

```
$ docker login
```

### Add tag to new image

```
$ docker image tag bradtraversy/nginx bradtraversy/nginx:testing
```

### DOCKERFILE PARTS

- FROM - The os used. Common is alpine, debian, ubuntu
- ENV - Environment variables
- RUN - Run commands/shell scripts, etc
- EXPOSE - Ports to expose
- CMD - Final command run when you launch a new container from image
- WORKDIR - Sets working directory (also could use 'RUN cd /some/path')
- COPY # Copies files from host to container

### Build image from dockerfile (reponame can be whatever)

### From the same directory as Dockerfile

```
$ docker image build -t [REPONAME] .
```

#### TIP: CACHE & ORDER

- If you re-run the build, it will be quick because everythging is cached.
- If you change one line and re-run, that line and everything after will not be cached
- Keep things that change the most toward the bottom of the Dockerfile

# EXTENDING DOCKERFILE

### Custom Dockerfile for html paqge with nginx

```
FROM nginx:latest # Extends nginx so everything included in that image is included here
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY index.html index.html
```

### Build image from Dockerfile

```
$ docker image build -t nginx-website
```

### Running it

```
$ docker container run -p 80:80 --rm nginx-website
```

### Tag and push to Dockerhub

```
$ docker image tag nginx-website:latest btraversy/nginx-website:latest
```

```
$ docker image push bradtraversy/nginx-website
```

# VOLUMES

### Volume - Makes special location outside of container UFS. Used for databases

### Bind Mount -Link container path to host path

### Check volumes

```
$ docker volume ls
```

### Cleanup unused volumes

```
$ docker volume prune
```

### Pull down mysql image to test

```
$ docker pull mysql
```

### Inspect and see volume

```
$ docker image inspect mysql
```

### Run container

```
$ docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True mysql
```

### Inspect and see volume in container

```
$ docker container inspect mysql
```

#### TIP: Mounts

- You will also see the volume under mounts
- Container gets its own uniqe location on the host to store that data
- Source: xxx is where it lives on the host

### Check volumes

```
$ docker volume ls
```

**There is no way to tell volumes apart for instance with 2 mysql containers, so we used named volumes**

### Named volumes (Add -v command)(the name here is mysql-db which could be anything)

```
$ docker container run -d --name mysql -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=True -v mysql-db:/var/lib/mysql mysql
```

### Inspect new named volume

```
docker volume inspect mysql-db
```

# BIND MOUNTS

- Can not use in Dockerfile, specified at run time (uses -v as well)
- ... run -v /Users/brad/stuff:/path/container (mac/linux)
- ... run -v //c/Users/brad/stuff:/path/container (windows)

**TIP: Instead of typing out local path, for working directory use $(pwd):/path/container - On windows may not work unless you are in your users folder**

### Run and be able to edit index.html file (local dir should have the Dockerfile and the index.html)

```
$ docker container run  -p 80:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
```

### Go into the container and check

```
$ docker container exec -it nginx bash
$ cd /usr/share/nginx/html
$ ls -al
```

### You could create a file in the container and it will exiost on the host as well

```
$ touch test.txt
```

# DOCKER COMPOSE

- Configure relationships between containers
- Save our docker container run settings in easy to read file
- 2 Parts: YAML File (docker.compose.yml) + CLI tool (docker-compose)

### 1. docker.compose.yml - Describes solutions for

- containers
- networks
- volumes

### 2. docker-compose CLI - used for local dev/test automation with YAML files

### Sample compose file (From Bret Fishers course)

```
version: '2'

# same as
# docker run -p 80:4000 -v $(pwd):/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve

services:
  jekyll:
    image: bretfisher/jekyll-serve
    volumes:
      - .:/site
    ports:
      - '80:4000'
```

### To run

```
docker-compose up
```

### You can run in background with

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### To cleanup

```
docker-compose down
```

###### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = 'Lydia';
  let age = 21;
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `Lydia` and `undefined`
- B: `Lydia` and `ReferenceError`
- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

</p>
</details>

###### 2. What's the output?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1);
}
```

- A: `0 1 2` and `0 1 2`
- B: `0 1 2` and `3 3 3`
- C: `3 3 3` and `0 1 2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Because of the event queue in JavaScript, the `setTimeout` callback function is called _after_ the loop has been executed. Since the variable `i` in the first loop was declared using the `var` keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of `i` by `1` each time, using the unary operator `++`. By the time the `setTimeout` callback function was invoked, `i` was equal to `3` in the first example.

In the second loop, the variable `i` was declared using the `let` keyword: variables declared with the `let` (and `const`) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between `{ }`). During each iteration, `i` will have a new value, and each value is scoped inside the loop.

</p>

###### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
const shape = {
  radius: 10,
  diameter() {
    return this.radius * 2;
  },
  perimeter: () => 2 * Math.PI * this.radius,
};

console.log(shape.diameter());
console.log(shape.perimeter());
```

- A: `20` and `62.83185307179586`
- B: `20` and `NaN`
- C: `20` and `63`
- D: `NaN` and `63`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Note that the value of `diameter` is a regular function, whereas the value of `perimeter` is an arrow function.

With arrow functions, the `this` keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call `perimeter`, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example).

There is no value `radius` on that object, which returns `NaN`.

</p>
</details>

---

###### 4. What's the output?

```javascript
+true;
!'Lydia';
```

- A: `1` and `false`
- B: `false` and `NaN`
- C: `false` and `false`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The unary plus tries to convert an operand to a number. `true` is `1`, and `false` is `0`.

The string `'Lydia'` is a truthy value. What we're actually asking, is "is this truthy value falsy?". This returns `false`.

</p>

###### 5. Which one is true?

```javascript
const bird = {
  size: 'small',
};

const mouse = {
  name: 'Mickey',
  small: true,
};
```

- A: `mouse.bird.size` is not valid
- B: `mouse[bird.size]` is not valid
- C: `mouse[bird["size"]]` is not valid
- D: All of them are valid

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not _type_ them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement.

`mouse[bird.size]`: First it evaluates `bird.size`, which is `"small"`. `mouse["small"]` returns `true`

However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. `mouse` does not have a key called `bird`, which means that `mouse.bird` is `undefined`. Then, we ask for the `size` using dot notation: `mouse.bird.size`. Since `mouse.bird` is `undefined`, we're actually asking `undefined.size`. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to `Cannot read property "size" of undefined`.

</p>

###### 6. What's the output?

```javascript
let c = { greeting: 'Hey!' };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = 'Hello';
console.log(d.greeting);
```

- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ko5k0fs.png" width="200">

When you change one object, you change all of them.

</p>
</details>

###### 7. What's the output?

```javascript
let a = 3;
let b = new Number(3);
let c = 3;

console.log(a == b);
console.log(a === b);
console.log(b === c);
```

- A: `true` `false` `true`
- B: `false` `false` `true`
- C: `true` `false` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`new Number()` is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object.

When we use the `==` operator, it only checks whether it has the same _value_. They both have the value of `3`, so it returns `true`.

However, when we use the `===` operator, both value _and_ type should be the same. It's not: `new Number()` is not a number, it's an **object**. Both return `false.`

</p>

###### 8. What's the output?

```javascript
class Chameleon {
  static colorChange(newColor) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
    return this.newColor;
  }

  constructor({ newColor = 'green' } = {}) {
    this.newColor = newColor;
  }
}

const freddie = new Chameleon({ newColor: 'purple' });
console.log(freddie.colorChange('orange'));
```

- A: `orange`
- B: `purple`
- C: `green`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `colorChange` function is static. Static methods are designed to live only on the constructor in which they are created, and cannot be passed down to any children. Since `freddie` is a child, the function is not passed down, and not available on the `freddie` instance: a `TypeError` is thrown.

</p>
</details>

###### 9. What's the output?

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {}; // Typo!
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

It logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped `greeting` as `greetign`, the JS interpreter actually saw this as `global.greetign = {}` (or `window.greetign = {}` in a browser).

In order to avoid this, we can use `"use strict"`. This makes sure that you have declared a variable before setting it equal to anything.

</p>
</details>

###### 10. What happens when we do this?

```javascript
function bark() {
  console.log('Woof!');
}

bark.animal = 'dog';
```

- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.

</p>
</details>

###### 11. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const member = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
Person.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};

console.log(member.getFullName());
```

- A: `TypeError`
- B: `SyntaxError`
- C: `Lydia Hallie`
- D: `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method `getFullName` gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call `Person.getFullName()`, but `member.getFullName` throws a `TypeError`. 

If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:

```js
Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};
```

</p>

###### 12. What's the output?

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}

const lydia = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
const sarah = Person('Sarah', 'Smith');

console.log(lydia);
console.log(sarah);
```

- A: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `undefined`
- B: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `Person {firstName: "Sarah", lastName: "Smith"}`
- C: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `{}`
- D: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

For `sarah`, we didn't use the `new` keyword. When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the **global object**!

We said that `this.firstName` equals `"Sarah"` and `this.lastName` equals `"Smith"`. What we actually did, is defining `global.firstName = 'Sarah'` and `global.lastName = 'Smith'`. `sarah` itself is left `undefined`, since we don't return a value from the `Person` function.

###### 13. What are the three phases of event propagation?

- A: Target > Capturing > Bubbling
- B: Bubbling > Target > Capturing
- C: Target > Bubbling > Capturing
- D: Capturing > Target > Bubbling

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

During the **capturing** phase, the event goes through the ancestor elements down to the target element. It then reaches the **target** element, and **bubbling** begins.

###### 14. All object have prototypes.

- A: true
- B: false

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

All objects have prototypes, except for the **base object**. The base object is the object created by the user, or an object that is created using the `new` keyword. The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as `.toString`. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype. Although JavaScript can't find it directly on your object, it goes down the prototype chain and finds it there, which makes it accessible for you.

###### 15. What's the output?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;

sum(1, '2');
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

JavaScript is a **dynamically typed language**: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called _implicit type coercion_. **Coercion** is converting from one type into another.

In this example, JavaScript converts the number `1` into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (`1`) and a string type (`'2'`), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like `"Hello" + "World"`, so what's happening here is `"1" + "2"` which returns `"12"`.

###### 16. What's the output?

```javascript
let number = 0;
console.log(number++);

- A: `1` `1` `2`
- B: `1` `2` `2`
- C: `0` `2` `2`
- D: `0` `1` `2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The **postfix** unary operator `++`:

1. Returns the value (this returns `0`)
2. Increments the value (number is now `1`)

The **prefix** unary operator `++`:

1. Increments the value (number is now `2`)
2. Returns the value (this returns `2`)

This returns `0 2 2`.

- A: `You are an adult!`
- B: `You are still an adult.`
- C: `Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When testing equality, primitives are compared by their _value_, while objects are compared by their _reference_. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.

The two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in memory than the object we used in order to check equality.

This is why both `{ age: 18 } === { age: 18 }` and `{ age: 18 } == { age: 18 }` return `false`.

- C: `"object"`
- D: `"NaN"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

###### 20. What's the output?

```javascript

getAge();
```

- A: `21`
- B: `undefined`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With `"use strict"`, you can make sure that you don't accidentally declare global variables. We never declared the variable `age`, and since we use `"use strict"`, it will throw a reference error. If we didn't use `"use strict"`, it would have worked, since the property `age` would have gotten added to the global object.

###### 21. What's the value of `sum`?

```javascript

- D: `"10*10+5"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`eval` evaluates codes that's passed as a string. If it's an expression, like in this case, it evaluates the expression. The expression is `10 * 10 + 5`. This returns the number `105`.

- C: `true` `true` `false` `true`
- D: `true` `true` `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

All object keys (excluding Symbols) are strings under the hood, even if you don't type it yourself as a string. This is why `obj.hasOwnProperty('1')` also returns true.

It doesn't work that way for a set. There is no `'1'` in our set: `set.has('1')` returns `false`. It has the numeric type `1`, `set.has(1)` returns `true`.

<p>

#### Answer: A

`String` is a built-in constructor, which we can add properties to. I just added a method to its prototype. Primitive strings are automatically converted into a string object, generated by the string prototype function. So, all strings (string objects) have access to that method!

###### 29. What's the output?

```javascript

```

- A: `123`
- B: `456`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are automatically converted into strings. We are trying to set an object as a key to object `a`, with the value of `123`.

However, when we stringify an object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. So what we are saying here, is that `a["[object Object]"] = 123`. Then, we can try to do the same again. `c` is another object that we are implicitly stringifying. So then, `a["[object Object]"] = 456`.

Then, we log `a[b]`, which is actually `a["[object Object]"]`. We just set that to `456`, so it returns `456`.

- B: `First` `Third` `Second`
- C: `Second` `First` `Third`
- D: `Second` `Third` `First`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

We have a `setTimeout` function and invoked it first. Yet, it was logged last.

This is because in browsers, we don't just have the runtime engine, we also have something called a `WebAPI`. The `WebAPI` gives us the `setTimeout` function to start with, and for example the DOM.

After the _callback_ is pushed to the WebAPI, the `setTimeout` function itself (but not the callback!) is popped off the stack.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X5wsHOg.png" width="200">

Now, `foo` gets invoked, and `"First"` is being logged.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Pvc0dGq.png" width="200">

`foo` is popped off the stack, and `baz` gets invoked. `"Third"` gets logged.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WhA2bCP.png" width="200">

The WebAPI can't just add stuff to the stack whenever it's ready. Instead, it pushes the callback function to something called the _queue_.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NSnDZmU.png" width="200">

This is where an event loop starts to work. An **event loop** looks at the stack and task queue. If the stack is empty, it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uyiScAI.png" width="200">

`bar` gets invoked, `"Second"` gets logged, and it's popped off the stack.

#### Answer: A

If we click `p`, we see two logs: `p` and `div`. During event propagation, there are 3 phases: capturing, target, and bubbling. By default, event handlers are executed in the bubbling phase (unless you set `useCapture` to `true`). It goes from the deepest nested element outwards.

- B: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`
- C: `1` `1` `2`
- D: `1` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `catch` block receives the argument `x`. This is not the same `x` as the variable when we pass arguments. This variable `x` is block-scoped.

Later, we set this block-scoped variable equal to `1`, and set the value of the variable `y`. Now, we log the block-scoped variable `x`, which is equal to `1`.

Outside of the `catch` block, `x` is still `undefined`, and `y` is `2`. When we want to `console.log(x)` outside of the `catch` block, it returns `undefined`, and `y` returns `2`.

###### 39. Everything in JavaScript is either a...

- A: primitive or object
- B: function or object
- C: trick question! only objects
- D: number or object

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

JavaScript only has primitive types and objects.

Primitive types are `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `bigint`, `number`, `string`, and `symbol`.

What differentiates a primitive from an object is that primitives do not have any properties or methods; however, you'll note that `'foo'.toUpperCase()` evaluates to `'FOO'` and does not result in a `TypeError`. This is because when you try to access a property or method on a primitive like a string, JavaScript will implicitly wrap the primitive type using one of the wrapper classes, i.e. `String`, and then immediately discard the wrapper after the expression evaluates. All primitives except for `null` and `undefined` exhibit this behaviour.

#### Answer: C

`[1, 2]` is our initial value. This is the value we start with, and the value of the very first `acc`. During the first round, `acc` is `[1,2]`, and `cur` is `[0, 1]`. We concatenate them, which results in `[1, 2, 0, 1]`.

Then, `[1, 2, 0, 1]` is `acc` and `[2, 3]` is `cur`. We concatenate them, and get `[1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 3]`

- D: `0, 10 and 10, 20`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Regular functions cannot be stopped mid-way after invocation. However, a generator function can be "stopped" midway, and later continue from where it stopped. Every time a generator function encounters a `yield` keyword, the function yields the value specified after it. Note that the generator function in that case doesn’t _return_ the value, it _yields_ the value.

First, we initialize the generator function with `i` equal to `10`. We invoke the generator function using the `next()` method. The first time we invoke the generator function, `i` is equal to `10`. It encounters the first `yield` keyword: it yields the value of `i`. The generator is now "paused", and `10` gets logged.

Then, we invoke the function again with the `next()` method. It starts to continue where it stopped previously, still with `i` equal to `10`. Now, it encounters the next `yield` keyword, and yields `i * 2`. `i` is equal to `10`, so it returns `10 * 2`, which is `20`. This results in `10, 20`.

- A: `"one"`
- B: `"two"`
- C: `"two" "one"`
- D: `"one" "two"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When we pass multiple promises to the `Promise.race` method, it resolves/rejects the _first_ promise that resolves/rejects. To the `setTimeout` method, we pass a timer: 500ms for the first promise (`firstPromise`), and 100ms for the second promise (`secondPromise`). This means that the `secondPromise` resolves first with the value of `'two'`. `res` now holds the value of `'two'`, which gets logged.

###### 46. What's the output?

```javascript

console.log(members);
```

- A: `null`
- B: `[null]`
- C: `[{}]`
- D: `[{ name: "Lydia" }]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

First, we declare a variable `person` with the value of an object that has a `name` property.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TML1MbS.png" width="200">

Then, we declare a variable called `members`. We set the first element of that array equal to the value of the `person` variable. Objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other. When you assign a reference from one variable to another, you make a _copy_ of that reference. (note that they don't have the _same_ reference!)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FSG5K3F.png" width="300">

Then, we set the variable `person` equal to `null`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/sYjcsMT.png" width="300">

We are only modifying the value of the `person` variable, and not the first element in the array, since that element has a different (copied) reference to the object. The first element in `members` still holds its reference to the original object. When we log the `members` array, the first element still holds the value of the object, which gets logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With a `for-in` loop, we can iterate through object keys, in this case `name` and `age`. Under the hood, object keys are strings (if they're not a Symbol). On every loop, we set the value of `item` equal to the current key it’s iterating over. First, `item` is equal to `name`, and gets logged. Then, `item` is equal to `age`, which gets logged.

```javascript

```

- A: `"345"`
- B: `"75"`
- C: `12`
- D: `"12"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Operator associativity is the order in which the compiler evaluates the expressions, either left-to-right or right-to-left. This only happens if all operators have the _same_ precedence. We only have one type of operator: `+`. For addition, the associativity is left-to-right.

`3 + 4` gets evaluated first. This results in the number `7`.

`7 + '5'` results in `"75"` because of coercion. JavaScript converts the number `7` into a string, see question 15. We can concatenate two strings using the `+`operator. `"7" + "5"` results in `"75"`.

###### 49. What's the value of `num`?

- A: `42`
- B: `"42"`
- C: `7`
- D: `NaN`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Only the first numbers in the string is returned. Based on the _radix_ (the second argument in order to specify what type of number we want to parse it to: base 10, hexadecimal, octal, binary, etc.), the `parseInt` checks whether the characters in the string are valid. Once it encounters a character that isn't a valid number in the radix, it stops parsing and ignores the following characters.

`*` is not a valid number. It only parses `"7"` into the decimal `7`. `num` now holds the value of `7`.

- A: `[]`
- B: `[null, null, null]`
- C: `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`
- D: `[ 3 x empty ]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When mapping over the array, the value of `num` is equal to the element it’s currently looping over. In this case, the elements are numbers, so the condition of the if statement `typeof num === "number"` returns `true`. The map function creates a new array and inserts the values returned from the function.

However, we don’t return a value. When we don’t return a value from the function, the function returns `undefined`. For every element in the array, the function block gets called, so for each element we return `undefined`.

- B: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1998"`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia" }, "1998"`
- D: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1997"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Arguments are passed by _value_, unless their value is an object, then they're passed by _reference_. `birthYear` is passed by value, since it's a string, not an object. When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46).

The variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `"1997"`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `"1997"`, but it's not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `"1998"`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `"1997"`.

The value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object. When we modify a property of the object `member` has a reference to, the value of `person` will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. `person`'s `name` property is now equal to the value `"Lydia"`

#### Answer: D

With the `throw` statement, we can create custom errors. With this statement, you can throw exceptions. An exception can be a <b>string</b>, a <b>number</b>, a <b>boolean</b> or an <b>object</b>. In this case, our exception is the string `'Hello world!'`.

With the `catch` statement, we can specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the `try` block. An exception is thrown: the string `'Hello world!'`. `e` is now equal to that string, which we log. This results in `'Oh an error: Hello world!'`.

When you return a property, the value of the property is equal to the _returned_ value, not the value set in the constructor function. We return the string `"Maserati"`, so `myCar.make` is equal to `"Maserati"`.

- B: `"number", "number"`
- C: `"object", "number"`
- D: `"number", "undefined"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`let x = (y = 10);` is actually shorthand for:

```javascript
y = 10;
let x = y;
```

When we set `y` equal to `10`, we actually add a property `y` to the global object (`window` in browser, `global` in Node). In a browser, `window.y` is now equal to `10`.

Then, we declare a variable `x` with the value of `y`, which is `10`. Variables declared with the `let` keyword are _block scoped_, they are only defined within the block they're declared in; the immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) in this case. When we use the `typeof` operator, the operand `x` is not defined: we are trying to access `x` outside of the block it's declared in. This means that `x` is not defined. Values who haven't been assigned a value or declared are of type `"undefined"`. `console.log(typeof x)` returns `"undefined"`.

However, we created a global variable `y` when setting `y` equal to `10`. This value is accessible anywhere in our code. `y` is defined, and holds a value of type `"number"`. `console.log(typeof y)` returns `"number"`.

- C: `"Woof I am Mara"`, `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`, `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We can delete properties from objects using the `delete` keyword, also on the prototype. By deleting a property on the prototype, it is not available anymore in the prototype chain. In this case, the `bark` function is not available anymore on the prototype after `delete Dog.prototype.bark`, yet we still try to access it.

When we try to invoke something that is not a function, a `TypeError` is thrown. In this case `TypeError: pet.bark is not a function`, since `pet.bark` is `undefined`.

#### Answer: D

The `Set` object is a collection of _unique_ values: a value can only occur once in a set.

We passed the iterable `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with a duplicate value `1`. Since we cannot have two of the same values in a set, one of them is removed. This results in `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.

- B: `"Lydia"`, `21`
- C: `true`, `true`
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: A

The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`. However, variables declared with the `var`, `const` or `let` keyword cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.

The `name` variable was declared with a `const` keyword, so its deletion is not successful: `false` is returned. When we set `age` equal to `21`, we actually added a property called `age` to the global object. You can successfully delete properties from objects this way, also the global object, so `delete age` returns `true`.

The value of `a` is now `1`, and the value of `b` is now `2`. What we actually did in the question, is:

```javascript
[y] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NzGkMNk.png" width="200">

This means that the value of `y` is equal to the first value in the array, which is the number `1`. When we log `y`, `1` is returned.

#### Answer: B

It's possible to combine objects using the spread operator `...`. It lets you create copies of the key/value pairs of one object, and add them to another object. In this case, we create copies of the `user` object, and add them to the `admin` object. The `admin` object now contains the copied key/value pairs, which results in `{ admin: true, name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `defineProperty` method, we can add new properties to an object, or modify existing ones. When we add a property to an object using the `defineProperty` method, they are by default _not enumerable_. The `Object.keys` method returns all _enumerable_ property names from an object, in this case only `"name"`.

Properties added using the `defineProperty` method are immutable by default. You can override this behavior using the `writable`, `configurable` and `enumerable` properties. This way, the `defineProperty` method gives you a lot more control over the properties you're adding to an object.

- D: `"{"username": "lydiahallie", "level":19, "health":90}"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The second argument of `JSON.stringify` is the _replacer_. The replacer can either be a function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.

If the replacer is an _array_, only the property names included in the array will be added to the JSON string. In this case, only the properties with the names `"level"` and `"health"` are included, `"username"` is excluded. `data` is now equal to `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`.

If the replacer is a _function_, this function gets called on every property in the object you're stringifying. The value returned from this function will be the value of the property when it's added to the JSON string. If the value is `undefined`, this property is excluded from the JSON string.

#### Answer: A

The unary operator `++` _first returns_ the value of the operand, _then increments_ the value of the operand. The value of `num1` is `10`, since the `increaseNumber` function first returns the value of `num`, which is `10`, and only increments the value of `num` afterwards.

`num2` is `10`, since we passed `num1` to the `increasePassedNumber`. `number` is equal to `10`(the value of `num1`. Again, the unary operator `++` _first returns_ the value of the operand, _then increments_ the value of the operand. The value of `number` is `10`, so `num2` is equal to `10`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

In ES6, we can initialize parameters with a default value. The value of the parameter will be the default value, if no other value has been passed to the function, or if the value of the parameter is `"undefined"`. In this case, we spread the properties of the `value` object into a new object, so `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`.

The default argument is evaluated at _call time_! Every time we call the function, a _new_ object is created. We invoke the `multiply` function the first two times without passing a value: `x` has the default value of `{ number: 10 }`. We then log the multiplied value of that number, which is `20`.

The third time we invoke multiply, we do pass an argument: the object called `value`. The `*=` operator is actually shorthand for `x.number = x.number * 2`: we modify the value of `x.number`, and log the multiplied value `20`.

The fourth time, we pass the `value` object again. `x.number` was previously modified to `20`, so `x.number *= 2` logs `40`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the _accumulator_, `x` in this case. The second argument is the _current value_, `y`. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value.

In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value.

The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional `initialValue` argument to the `reduce` method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call.

On the first call, the accumulator (`x`) is `1`, and the current value (`y`) is `2`. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator and current value: `1` and `2` get logged.

If you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`. On the next call, the accumulator is `undefined`, and the current value is `3`. `undefined` and `3` get logged.

On the fourth call, we again don't return from the callback function. The accumulator is again `undefined`, and the current value is `4`. `undefined` and `4` get logged.

#### Answer: B

In a derived class, you cannot access the `this` keyword before calling `super`. If you try to do that, it will throw a ReferenceError: 1 and 4 would throw a reference error.

With the `super` keyword, we call that parent class's constructor with the given arguments. The parent's constructor receives the `name` argument, so we need to pass `name` to `super`.

The `Labrador` class receives two arguments, `name` since it extends `Dog`, and `size` as an extra property on the `Labrador` class. They both need to be passed to the constructor function on `Labrador`, which is done correctly using constructor 2.

With the `import` keyword, all imported modules are _pre-parsed_. This means that the imported modules get run _first_, the code in the file which imports the module gets executed _after_.

This is a difference between `require()` in CommonJS and `import`! With `require()`, you can load dependencies on demand while the code is being run. If we would have used `require` instead of `import`, `running index.js`, `running sum.js`, `3` would have been logged to the console.

Every Symbol is entirely unique. The purpose of the argument passed to the Symbol is to give the Symbol a description. The value of the Symbol is not dependent on the passed argument.

- D: `"Lydia Hallie"`, `"Lyd"`,

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `padStart` method, we can add padding to the beginning of a string. The value passed to this method is the _total_ length of the string together with the padding. The string `"Lydia Hallie"` has a length of `12`. `name.padStart(13)` inserts 1 space at the start of the string, because 12 + 1 is 13.

If the argument passed to the `padStart` method is smaller than the length of the array, no padding will be added.

```javascript
console.log('🥑' + '💻');
```

- A: `"🥑💻"`
- B: `257548`
- C: A string containing their code points
- D: Error

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With the `+` operator, you can concatenate strings. In this case, we are concatenating the string `"🥑"` with the string `"💻"`, resulting in `"🥑💻"`.

###### 71. How can we log the values that are commented out after the console.log statement?

```javascript
function* startGame() {
  const answer = yield 'Do you love JavaScript?';
  if (answer !== 'Yes') {
    return "Oh wow... Guess we're gone here";
  }
  return 'JavaScript loves you back ❤️';
}

const game = startGame();
console.log(/* 1 */); // Do you love JavaScript?
console.log(/* 2 */); // JavaScript loves you back ❤️
```

- A: `game.next("Yes").value` and `game.next().value`
- B: `game.next.value("Yes")` and `game.next.value()`
- C: `game.next().value` and `game.next("Yes").value`
- D: `game.next.value()` and `game.next.value("Yes")`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

A generator function "pauses" its execution when it sees the `yield` keyword. First, we have to let the function yield the string "Do you love JavaScript?", which can be done by calling `game.next().value`.

Every line is executed, until it finds the first `yield` keyword. There is a `yield` keyword on the first line within the function: the execution stops with the first yield! _This means that the variable `answer` is not defined yet!_

When we call `game.next("Yes").value`, the previous `yield` is replaced with the value of the parameters passed to the `next()` function, `"Yes"` in this case. The value of the variable `answer` is now equal to `"Yes"`. The condition of the if-statement returns `false`, and `JavaScript loves you back ❤️` gets logged.

###### 72. What's the output?

```javascript
console.log(String.raw`Hello\nworld`);
```

- A: `Hello world!`
- B: `Hello` <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`
- C: `Hello\nworld`
- D: `Hello\n` <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;`world`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`String.raw` returns a string where the escapes (`\n`, `\v`, `\t` etc.) are ignored! Backslashes can be an issue since you could end up with something like:

`` const path = `C:\Documents\Projects\table.html` ``

Which would result in:

`"C:DocumentsProjects able.html"`

With `String.raw`, it would simply ignore the escape and print:

`C:\Documents\Projects\table.html`

In this case, the string is `Hello\nworld`, which gets logged.

###### 73. What's the output?

```javascript
async function getData() {
  return await Promise.resolve('I made it!');
}

const data = getData();
console.log(data);
```

- A: `"I made it!"`
- B: `Promise {<resolved>: "I made it!"}`
- C: `Promise {<pending>}`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

An async function always returns a promise. The `await` still has to wait for the promise to resolve: a pending promise gets returned when we call `getData()` in order to set `data` equal to it.

If we wanted to get access to the resolved value `"I made it"`, we could have used the `.then()` method on `data`:

`data.then(res => console.log(res))`

This would've logged `"I made it!"`

###### 74. What's the output?

```javascript
function addToList(item, list) {
  return list.push(item);
}

const result = addToList('apple', ['banana']);
console.log(result);
```

- A: `['apple', 'banana']`
- B: `2`
- C: `true`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The `.push()` method returns the _length_ of the new array! Previously, the array contained one element (the string `"banana"`) and had a length of `1`. After adding the string `"apple"` to the array, the array contains two elements, and has a length of `2`. This gets returned from the `addToList` function.

The `push` method modifies the original array. If you wanted to return the _array_ from the function rather than the _length of the array_, you should have returned `list` after pushing `item` to it.

###### 75. What's the output?

```javascript
const box = { x: 10, y: 20 };

Object.freeze(box);

const shape = box;
shape.x = 100;

console.log(shape);
```

- A: `{ x: 100, y: 20 }`
- B: `{ x: 10, y: 20 }`
- C: `{ x: 100 }`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`Object.freeze` makes it impossible to add, remove, or modify properties of an object (unless the property's value is another object).

When we create the variable `shape` and set it equal to the frozen object `box`, `shape` also refers to a frozen object. You can check whether an object is frozen by using `Object.isFrozen`. In this case, `Object.isFrozen(shape)` returns true, since the variable `shape` has a reference to a frozen object.

Since `shape` is frozen, and since the value of `x` is not an object, we cannot modify the property `x`. `x` is still equal to `10`, and `{ x: 10, y: 20 }` gets logged.

###### 76. What's the output?

```javascript
const { name: myName } = { name: 'Lydia' };

console.log(name);
```

- A: `"Lydia"`
- B: `"myName"`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

When we unpack the property `name` from the object on the right-hand side, we assign its value `"Lydia"` to a variable with the name `myName`.

With `{ name: myName }`, we tell JavaScript that we want to create a new variable called `myName` with the value of the `name` property on the right-hand side.

Since we try to log `name`, a variable that is not defined, a ReferenceError gets thrown.

###### 77. Is this a pure function?

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

- A: Yes
- B: No

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

A pure function is a function that _always_ returns the same result, if the same arguments are passed.

The `sum` function always returns the same result. If we pass `1` and `2`, it will _always_ return `3` without side effects. If we pass `5` and `10`, it will _always_ return `15`, and so on. This is the definition of a pure function.

###### 78. What is the output?

```javascript
const add = () => {
  const cache = {};
  return num => {
    if (num in cache) {
      return `From cache! ${cache[num]}`;
    } else {
      const result = num + 10;
      cache[num] = result;
      return `Calculated! ${result}`;
    }
  };
};

const addFunction = add();
console.log(addFunction(10));
console.log(addFunction(10));
console.log(addFunction(5 * 2));
```

- A: `Calculated! 20` `Calculated! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- B: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- C: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `From cache! 20`
- D: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.

If we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the caches value will be returned, which saves on execution time. Else, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterwards.

We call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.

The second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

The third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

- C: `"☕"` `"💻"` `"🍷"` `"🍫"` and `0` `1` `2` `3`
- D: `0` `1` `2` `3` and `{0: "☕", 1: "💻", 2: "🍷", 3: "🍫"}`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With a _for-in_ loop, we can iterate over **enumerable** properties. In an array, the enumerable properties are the "keys" of array elements, which are actually their indexes. You could see an array as:

`{0: "☕", 1: "💻", 2: "🍷", 3: "🍫"}`

Where the keys are the enumerable properties. `0` `1` `2` `3` get logged.

With a _for-of_ loop, we can iterate over **iterables**. An array is an iterable. When we iterate over the array, the variable "item" is equal to the element it's currently iterating over, `"☕"` `"💻"` `"🍷"` `"🍫"` get logged.

###### 80. What is the output?

```javascript
const list = [1 + 2, 1 * 2, 1 / 2];
console.log(list);
```

- A: `["1 + 2", "1 * 2", "1 / 2"]`

- C: `[3, 2, 0.5]`
- D: `[1, 1, 1]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Array elements can hold any value. Numbers, strings, objects, other arrays, null, boolean values, undefined, and other expressions such as dates, functions, and calculations.

The element will be equal to the returned value. `1 + 2` returns `3`, `1 * 2` returns `2`, and `1 / 2` returns `0.5`.

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

By default, arguments have the value of `undefined`, unless a value has been passed to the function. In this case, we didn't pass a value for the `name` argument. `name` is equal to `undefined` which gets logged.

In ES6, we can overwrite this default `undefined` value with default parameters. For example:

`function sayHi(name = "Lydia") { ... }`

In this case, if we didn't pass a value or if we passed `undefined`, `name` would always be equal to the string `Lydia`

###### 82. What is the output?

```javascript
var status = '😎';

setTimeout(() => {
  const status = '😍';

  const data = {
    status: '🥑',
    getStatus() {
      return this.status;
    },
  };

  console.log(data.getStatus());
  console.log(data.getStatus.call(this));
}, 0);
```

- A: `"🥑"` and `"😍"`
- B: `"🥑"` and `"😎"`
- C: `"😍"` and `"😎"`
- D: `"😎"` and `"😎"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The value of the `this` keyword is dependent on where you use it. In a **method**, like the `getStatus` method, the `this` keyword refers to _the object that the method belongs to_. The method belongs to the `data` object, so `this` refers to the `data` object. When we log `this.status`, the `status` property on the `data` object gets logged, which is `"🥑"`.

With the `call` method, we can change the object to which the `this` keyword refers. In **functions**, the `this` keyword refers to the _the object that the function belongs to_. We declared the `setTimeout` function on the _global object_, so within the `setTimeout` function, the `this` keyword refers to the _global object_. On the global object, there is a variable called _status_ with the value of `"😎"`. When logging `this.status`, `"😎"` gets logged.

###### 83. What is the output?

```javascript
const person = {

```

- A: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- B: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: "Amsterdam" }`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: undefined }`
- D: `"Amsterdam"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `city` equal to the value of the property called `city` on the `person` object. There is no property on this object called `city`, so the variable `city` has the value of `undefined`.

Note that we are _not_ referencing the `person` object itself! We simply set the variable `city` equal to the current value of the `city` property on the `person` object.

Then, we set `city` equal to the string `"Amsterdam"`. This doesn't change the person object: there is no reference to that object.

When logging the `person` object, the unmodified object gets returned.

- C: The result of the callback in the previous `.then()`.
- D: It would always be undefined.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

###### 86. Which option is a way to set `hasName` equal to `true`, provided you cannot pass `true` as an argument?

```javascript
function getName(name) {
  const hasName = //
}
```

- A: `!!name`
- B: `name`
- C: `new Boolean(name)`
- D: `name.length`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With `!!name`, we determine whether the value of `name` is truthy or falsy. If name is truthy, which we want to test for, `!name` returns `false`. `!false` (which is what `!!name` practically is) returns `true`.

By setting `hasName` equal to `name`, you set `hasName` equal to whatever value you passed to the `getName` function, not the boolean value `true`.

`new Boolean(true)` returns an object wrapper, not the boolean value itself.

`name.length` returns the length of the passed argument, not whether it's `true`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: B

In order to get an character on a specific index in a string, you can use bracket notation. The first character in the string has index 0, and so on. In this case we want to get the element which index is 0, the character `"I'`, which gets logged.

Note that this method is not supported in IE7 and below. In that case, use `.charAt()`

sum(10);
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `20`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

You can set a default parameter's value equal to another parameter of the function, as long as they've been defined _before_ the default parameter. We pass the value `10` to the `sum` function. If the `sum` function only receives 1 argument, it means that the value for `num2` is not passed, and the value of `num1` is equal to the passed value `10` in this case. The default value of `num2` is the value of `num1`, which is `10`. `num1 + num2` returns `20`.

If you're trying to set a default parameter's value equal to a parameter which is defined _after_ (to the right), the parameter's value hasn't been initialized yet, which will throw an error.

- A: `{ default: function default(), name: "Lydia" }`
- B: `{ default: function default() }`
- C: `{ default: "Hello world", name: "Lydia" }`
- D: Global object of `module.js`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With the `import * as name` syntax, we import _all exports_ from the `module.js` file into the `index.js` file as a new object called `data` is created. In the `module.js` file, there are two exports: the default export, and a named export. The default export is a function which returns the string `"Hello World"`, and the named export is a variable called `name` which has the value of the string `"Lydia"`.

The `data` object has a `default` property for the default export, other properties have the names of the named exports and their corresponding values.

Classes are syntactical sugar for function constructors. The equivalent of the `Person` class as a function constructor would be:

```javascript
function Person() {
  this.name = name;
}
```

Calling a function constructor with `new` results in the creation of an instance of `Person`, `typeof` keyword returns `"object"` for an instance. `typeof member` returns `"object"`.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `.push` method returns the _new length_ of the array, not the array itself! By setting `newList` equal to `[1, 2, 3].push(4)`, we set `newList` equal to the new length of the array: `4`.

Then, we try to use the `.push` method on `newList`. Since `newList` is the numerical value `4`, we cannot use the `.push` method: a TypeError is thrown.

Regular functions, such as the `giveLydiaPizza` function, have a `prototype` property, which is an object (prototype object) with a `constructor` property. Arrow functions however, such as the `giveLydiaChocolate` function, do not have this `prototype` property. `undefined` gets returned when trying to access the `prototype` property using `giveLydiaChocolate.prototype`.

- C: `["name", "age"]` and `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:

`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]`

Using the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray.

The first subarray is `[ "name", "Lydia" ]`, with `x` equal to `"name"`, and `y` equal to `"Lydia"`, which get logged.
The second subarray is `[ "age", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `"age"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: D

`...args` is a rest parameter. The rest parameter's value is an array containing all remaining arguments, **and can only be the last parameter**! In this example, the rest parameter was the second parameter. This is not possible, and will throw a syntax error.

```javascript
function getItems(fruitList, favoriteFruit, ...args) {
  return [...fruitList, ...args, favoriteFruit];
}

getItems(['banana', 'apple'], 'pear', 'orange');

The above example works. This returns the array `[ 'banana', 'apple', 'orange', 'pear' ]`

- C: `undefined` and `undefined`
- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't _have_ to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```javascript
return;
a + b;
```

This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

A Symbol is not _enumerable_. The Object.keys method returns all _enumerable_ key properties on an object. The Symbol won't be visible, and an empty array is returned. When logging the entire object, all properties will be visible, even non-enumerable ones.

This is one of the many qualities of a symbol: besides representing an entirely unique value (which prevents accidental name collision on objects, for example when working with 2 libraries that want to add properties to the same object), you can also "hide" properties on objects this way (although not entirely. You can still access symbols using the `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` method).

###### 98. What's the output?

```javascript
const getList = ([x, ...y]) => [x, y]
const getUser = user => { name: user.name, age: user.age }

const list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
const user = { name: "Lydia", age: 21 }

console.log(getList(list))
console.log(getUser(user))
```

- A: `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` and `undefined`
- B: `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- C: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`
- D: `Error` and `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `getList` function receives an array as its argument. Between the parentheses of the `getList` function, we destructure this array right away. You could see this as:

`[x, ...y] = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

With the rest parameter `...y`, we put all "remaining" arguments in an array. The remaining arguments are `2`, `3` and `4` in this case. The value of `y` is an array, containing all the rest parameters. The value of `x` is equal to `1` in this case, so when we log `[x, y]`, `[1, [2, 3, 4]]` gets logged.

The `getUser` function receives an object. With arrow functions, we don't _have_ to write curly brackets if we just return one value. However, if you want to return an _object_ from an arrow function, you have to write it between parentheses, otherwise no value gets returned! The following function would have returned an object:

`const getUser = user => ({ name: user.name, age: user.age })`

Since no value gets returned in this case, the function returns `undefined`.

###### 99. What's the output?

```javascript
const name = 'Lydia';

console.log(name());
```

- A: `SyntaxError`
- B: `ReferenceError`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The variable `name` holds the value of a string, which is not a function, thus cannot invoke.

TypeErrors get thrown when a value is not of the expected type. JavaScript expected `name` to be a function since we're trying to invoke it. It was a string however, so a TypeError gets thrown: name is not a function!

SyntaxErrors get thrown when you've written something that isn't valid JavaScript, for example when you've written the word `return` as `retrun`.
ReferenceErrors get thrown when JavaScript isn't able to find a reference to a value that you're trying to access.

- D: `Impossible! You shouldn't see a therapist after so much JavaScript lol`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

`[]` is a truthy value. With the `&&` operator, the right-hand value will be returned if the left-hand value is a truthy value. In this case, the left-hand value `[]` is a truthy value, so `"Im'` gets returned.

`""` is a falsy value. If the left-hand value is falsy, nothing gets returned. `n't` doesn't get returned.

- C: `{}` `""` `[]`
- D: `null` `null` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `||` operator, we can return the first truthy operand. If all values are falsy, the last operand gets returned.

`(false || {} || null)`: the empty object `{}` is a truthy value. This is the first (and only) truthy value, which gets returned. `one` is equal to `{}`.

`(null || false || "")`: all operands are falsy values. This means that the last operand, `""` gets returned. `two` is equal to `""`.

`([] || 0 || "")`: the empty array`[]` is a truthy value. This is the first truthy value, which gets returned. `three` is equal to `[]`.

- D: `second`, `I have resolved!` and `I have resolved!`, `second`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With a promise, we basically say _I want to execute this function, but I'll put it aside for now while it's running since this might take a while. Only when a certain value is resolved (or rejected), and when the call stack is empty, I want to use this value._

We can get this value with both `.then` and the `await` keyword in an `async` function. Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently.

In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty.

With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

This means that it waited for the `myPromise` to resolve with the value `I have resolved`, and only once that happened, we moved to the next line: `second` got logged.

- C: `3`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`
- D: `"12"`, `Lydia2`, `[object Object]2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `+` operator is not only used for adding numerical values, but we can also use it to concatenate strings. Whenever the JavaScript engine sees that one or more values are not a number, it coerces the number into a string.

The first one is `1`, which is a numerical value. `1 + 2` returns the number 3.

However, the second one is a string `"Lydia"`. `"Lydia"` is a string and `2` is a number: `2` gets coerced into a string. `"Lydia"` and `"2"` get concatenated, which results in the string `"Lydia2"`.

`{ name: "Lydia" }` is an object. Neither a number nor an object is a string, so it stringifies both. Whenever we stringify a regular object, it becomes `"[object Object]"`. `"[object Object]"` concatenated with `"2"` becomes `"[object Object]2"`.

- B: `Promise {<pending>: 5}`
- C: `Promise {<fulfilled>: 5}`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

We can pass any type of value we want to `Promise.resolve`, either a promise or a non-promise. The method itself returns a promise with the resolved value (`<fulfilled>`). If you pass a regular function, it'll be a resolved promise with a regular value. If you pass a promise, it'll be a resolved promise with the resolved value of that passed promise.

In this case, we just passed the numerical value `5`. It returns a resolved promise with the value `5`.

- A: `Not the same!`
- B: `They are the same!`

- D: `SyntaxError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Objects are passed by reference. When we check objects for strict equality (`===`), we're comparing their references.

We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.

This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

The code block in the `else` statement gets run, and `They are the same!` gets logged.

```

- A: `true`
- B: `false`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

In JavaScript, we have two ways to access properties on an object: bracket notation, or dot notation. In this example, we use dot notation (`colorConfig.colors`) instead of bracket notation (`colorConfig["colors"]`).

With dot notation, JavaScript tries to find the property on the object with that exact name. In this example, JavaScript tries to find a property called `colors` on the `colorConfig` object. There is no property called `colors`, so this returns `undefined`. Then, we try to access the value of the first element by using `[1]`. We cannot do this on a value that's `undefined`, so it throws a `TypeError`: `Cannot read property '1' of undefined`.

JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket `[` and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket `]`. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. If we would've used `colorConfig[colors[1]]`, it would have returned the value of the `red` property on the `colorConfig` object.

With `splice` method, we modify the original array by deleting, replacing or adding elements. In this case, we removed 2 items from index 1 (we removed `'🥑'` and `'😍'`) and added the ✨ emoji instead.

`map`, `filter` and `slice` return a new array, `find` returns an element, and `reduce` returns a reduced value.

- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the string with the pizza emoji, `'🍕'`. A string is a primitive data type. In JavaScript, primitive data types don't interact by reference.

In JavaScript, primitive data types (everything that's not an object) interact by _value_. In this case, we set the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object equal to the value of the first element in the `food` array, the string with the pizza emoji in this case (`'🍕'`). A string is a primitive data type, and interact by value (see my [blogpost](https://www.theavocoder.com/complete-javascript/2018/12/21/by-value-vs-by-reference) if you're interested in learning more)

Then, we change the value of the `favoriteFood` property on the `info` object. The `food` array hasn't changed, since the value of `favoriteFood` was merely a _copy_ of the value of the first element in the array, and doesn't have a reference to the same spot in memory as the element on `food[0]`. When we log food, it's still the original array, `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`.

const jsonArray = JSON.stringify([1, 2, 3]); // '[1, 2, 3]'
JSON.parse(jsonArray); // [1, 2, 3]

// Stringifying an object  into valid JSON, then parsing the JSON string to a JavaScript value:
const jsonArray = JSON.stringify({ name: 'Lydia' }); // '{"name":"Lydia"}'

}

getName();
```

- A: Lydia
- B: Sarah
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Each function has its own _execution context_ (or _scope_). The `getName` function first looks within its own context (scope) to see if it contains the variable `name` we're trying to access. In this case, the `getName` function contains its own `name` variable: we declare the variable `name` with the `let` keyword, and with the value of `'Sarah'`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

If we wouldn't have declared the `name` variable within the `getName` function, the javascript engine would've looked down the _scope chain_. The outer scope has a variable called `name` with the value of `Lydia`. In that case, it would've logged `Lydia`.

```javascript
let name = 'Lydia';

function getName() {
  console.log(name);
}

getName(); // Lydia
```

- C: `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `a`
- D: `a` and `['a', 'b', 'c']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `yield` keyword, we `yield` values in a generator function. With the `yield*` keyword, we can yield values from another generator function, or iterable object (for example an array).

In `generatorOne`, we yield the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']` using the `yield` keyword. The value of `value` property on the object returned by the `next` method on `one` (`one.next().value`) is equal to the entire array `['a', 'b', 'c']`.

```javascript
console.log(one.next().value); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
console.log(one.next().value); // undefined
```

In `generatorTwo`, we use the `yield*` keyword. This means that the first yielded value of `two`, is equal to the first yielded value in the iterator. The iterator is the array `['a', 'b', 'c']`. The first yielded value is `a`, so the first time we call `two.next().value`, `a` is returned.

```javascript
console.log(two.next().value); // 'a'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'b'
console.log(two.next().value); // 'c'
console.log(two.next().value); // undefined

#### Answer: A

Expressions within template literals are evaluated first. This means that the string will contain the returned value of the expression, the immediately invoked function `(x => x)('I love')` in this case. We pass the value `'I love'` as an argument to the `x => x` arrow function. `x` is equal to `'I love'`, which gets returned. This results in `I love to program`.

###### 114. What will happen?

```javascript

- A: The `setInterval` callback won't be invoked
- B: The `setInterval` callback gets invoked once
- C: The `setInterval` callback will still be called every second
- D: We never invoked `config.alert()`, config is `null`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Normally when we set objects equal to `null`, those objects get _garbage collected_ as there is no reference anymore to that object. However, since the callback function within `setInterval` is an arrow function (thus bound to the `config` object), the callback function still holds a reference to the `config` object. 
As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected. 
Since this is an interval, setting `config` to `null` or `delete`-ing `config.alert` won't garbage-collect the interval, so the interval will still be called. 
It should be cleared with `clearInterval(config.alert)` to remove it from memory.
Since it was not cleared, the `setInterval` callback function will still get invoked every 1000ms (1s).

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 2 and 3
- D: All of them

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When adding a key/value pair using the `set` method, the key will be the value of the first argument passed to the `set` function, and the value will be the second argument passed to the `set` function. The key is the _function_ `() => 'greeting'` in this case, and the value `'Hello world'`. `myMap` is now `{ () => 'greeting' => 'Hello world!' }`.

1 is wrong, since the key is not `'greeting'` but `() => 'greeting'`.
3 is wrong, since we're creating a new function by passing it as a parameter to the `get` method. Object interact by _reference_. Functions are objects, which is why two functions are never strictly equal, even if they are identical: they have a reference to a different spot in memory.

- C: `{name: "Lydia", age: 22}`
- D: `{name: "Lydia", age: 23}`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Both the `changeAge` and `changeAgeAndName` functions have a default parameter, namely a _newly_ created object `{ ...person }`. This object has copies of all the key/values in the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `changeAge` function and pass the `person` object as its argument. This function increases the value of the `age` property by 1. `person` is now `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

Then, we invoke the `changeAgeAndName` function, however we don't pass a parameter. Instead, the value of `x` is equal to a _new_ object: `{ ...person }`. Since it's a new object, it doesn't affect the values of the properties on the `person` object. `person` is still equal to `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`.

With the spread operator `...`, we can _spread_ iterables to individual elements. The `sumValues` function receives three arguments: `x`, `y` and `z`. `...[1, 2, 3]` will result in `1, 2, 3`, which we pass to the `sumValues` function.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the optional chaining operator `?.`, we no longer have to explicitly check whether the deeper nested values are valid or not. If we're trying to access a property on an `undefined` or `null` value (_nullish_), the expression short-circuits and returns `undefined`.

`person.pet?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. It has a property called `name`, and returns `Mara`.
`person.pet?.family?.name`: `person` has a property named `pet`: `person.pet` is not nullish. `pet` does _not_ have a property called `family`, `person.pet.family` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.
`person.getFullName?.()`: `person` has a property named `getFullName`: `person.getFullName()` is not nullish and can get invoked, which returns `Lydia Hallie`.
`member.getLastName?.()`: `member` is not defined: `member.getLastName()` is nullish. The expression returns `undefined`.

We passed the condition `groceries.indexOf("banana")` to the if-statement. `groceries.indexOf("banana")` returns `0`, which is a falsy value. Since the condition in the if-statement is falsy, the code in the `else` block runs, and `We don't have to buy bananas!` gets logged.

- A: `false` `true`
- B: `true` `false`
- C: `false` `false`
- D: `true` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

`typeof name` returns `"string"`. The string `"string"` is a truthy value, so `!typeof name` returns the boolean value `false`. `false === "object"` and `false === "string"` both return`false`.

(If we wanted to check whether the type was (un)equal to a certain type, we should've written `!==` instead of `!typeof`)

###### 123. What's the output?

```javascript
const add = x => y => z => {

add(4)(5)(6);
```

- A: `4` `5` `6`
- B: `6` `5` `4`
- C: `4` `function` `function`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `6`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `add` function returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function, which returns an arrow function (still with me?). The first function receives an argument `x` with the value of `4`. We invoke the second function, which receives an argument `y` with the value `5`. Then we invoke the third function, which receives an argument `z` with the value `6`. When we're trying to access the value `x`, `y` and `z` within the last arrow function, the JS engine goes up the scope chain in order to find the values for `x` and `y` accordingly. This returns `4` `5` `6`.

###### 124. What's the output?

```javascript

(async () => {
  const gen = range(1, 3);

- C: `1` `2` `3`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The generator function `range` returns an async object with promises for each item in the range we pass: `Promise{1}`, `Promise{2}`, `Promise{3}`. We set the variable `gen` equal to the async object, after which we loop over it using a `for await ... of` loop. We set the variable `item` equal to the returned Promise values: first `Promise{1}`, then `Promise{2}`, then `Promise{3}`. Since we're _awaiting_ the value of `item`, the resolved promsie, the resolved _values_ of the promises get returned: `1`, `2`, then `3`.

- C: `{ 1: undefined }` `undefined` `undefined`
- D: `undefined` `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`myFunc` expects an object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` as its argument. Since we're only passing three separate numeric values (1, 2, 3) instead of one object with properties `x`, `y` and `z` ({x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}), `x`, `y` and `z` have their default value of `undefined`.

- C: The driver drove undefined and has to pay undefined
- D: The driver drove 130.00 and has to pay 300.00

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `Intl.NumberFormat` method, we can format numeric values to any locale. We format the numeric value `130` to the `en-US` locale as a `unit` in `mile-per-hour`, which results in `130 mph`. The numeric value `300` to the `en-US` locale as a `currency` in `USD` results in `$300.00`.

- D: `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "[object Object]"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

By destructuring objects, we can unpack values from the right-hand object, and assign the unpacked value to the value of the same property name on the left-hand object. In this case, we're assigning the value "💀" to `spookyItems[3]`. This means that we're modifying the `spookyItems` array, we're adding the "💀" to it. When logging `spookyItems`, `["👻", "🎃", "🕸", "💀"]` gets logged.

- C: `false` `false` `true` `false`
- D: `false` `true` `false` `true`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the `Number.isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is a _numeric value_ and equal to `NaN`. `name` is not a numeric value, so `Number.isNaN(name)` returns `false`. `age` is a numeric value, but is not equal to `NaN`, so `Number.isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

With the `isNaN` method, you can check if the value you pass is not a number. `name` is not a number, so `isNaN(name)` returns true. `age` is a number, so `isNaN(age)` returns `false`.

- A: `"number"`

- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Variables declared with the `const` keyword are not referencable before their initialization: this is called the _temporal dead zone_. In the `getInfo` function, the variable `randomValue` is scoped in the functional scope of `getInfo`. On the line where we want to log the value of `typeof randomValue`, the variable `randomValue` isn't initialized yet: a `ReferenceError` gets thrown! The engine didn't go down the scope chain since we declared the variable `randomValue` in the `getInfo` function.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

In the `try` block, we're logging the awaited value of the `myPromise` variable: `"Woah some cool data"`. Since no errors were thrown in the `try` block, the code in the `catch` block doesn't run. The code in the `finally` block _always_ runs, `"Oh finally!"` gets logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: B

With the `flat` method, we can create a new, flattened array. The depth of the flattened array depends on the value that we pass. In this case, we passed the value `1` (which we didn't have to, that's the default value), meaning that only the arrays on the first depth will be concatenated. `['🥑']` and `['✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]` in this case. Concatenating these two arrays results in `['🥑', '✨', '✨', ['🍕', '🍕']]`.

```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `2`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`counterOne` is an instance of the `Counter` class. The counter class contains a `count` property on its constructor, and an `increment` method. First, we invoked the `increment` method twice by calling `counterOne.increment()`. Currently, `counterOne.count` is `2`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KxLlTm9.png" width="400">

Then, we create a new variable `counterTwo`, and set it equal to `counterOne`. Since objects interact by reference, we're just creating a new reference to the same spot in memory that `counterOne` points to. Since it has the same spot in memory, any changes made to the object that `counterTwo` has a reference to, also apply to `counterOne`. Currently, `counterTwo.count` is `2`.

We invoke the `counterTwo.increment()`, which sets the `count` to `3`. Then, we log the count on `counterOne`, which logs `3`.

- C: `Promise! Last line! Last line! Promise! Timeout! Timeout!`
- D: `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. While the engine is busy completing the promise, it keeps on running the function `funcOne`. The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop <a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif">here</a>.)

Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation. This is the last line of `funcOne`, the promise resolved, and `Promise!` gets logged. However, since we're invoking `funcTwo()`, the call stack isn't empty, and the callback of the `setTimeout` function cannot get added to the callstack yet.

In `funcTwo` we're, first _awaiting_ the myPromise promise. With the `await` keyword, we pause the execution of the function until the promise has resolved (or rejected). Then, we log the awaited value of `res` (since the promise itself returns a promise). This logs `Promise!`.

The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API.

We get to the last line of `funcTwo`, which logs `Last line!` to the console. Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log("Timeout!")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log("Timeout!")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. This logs `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`

###### 134. How can we invoke `sum` in `sum.js` from `index.js?`

```javascript
// sum.js
export default function sum(x) {
  return x + x;
}

// index.js
import * as sum from './sum';
```

- A: `sum(4)`
- B: `sum.sum(4)`
- C: `sum.default(4)`
- D: Default aren't imported with `*`, only named exports

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With the asterisk `*`, we import all exported values from that file, both default and named. If we had the following file:

```javascript
// info.js
export const name = 'Lydia';
export const age = 21;
export default 'I love JavaScript';

// index.js
import * as info from './info';
console.log(info);
```

The following would get logged:

```javascript
{
  default: "I love JavaScript",
  name: "Lydia",
  age: 21
}
```

For the `sum` example, it means that the imported value `sum` looks like this:

```javascript
{ default: function sum(x) { return x + x } }
```

We can invoke this function, by calling `sum.default`

- B: `Accessed a property!`
- C: `Added a new property!` `Accessed a property!`
- D: Nothing gets logged

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

With a Proxy object, we can add custom behavior to an object that we pass to it as the second argument. In this case, we pass the `handler` object which contained to properties: `set` and `get`. `set` gets invoked whenever we _set_ property values, `get` gets invoked whenever we _get_ (access) property values.

The first argument is an empty object `{}`, which is the value of `person`. To this object, the custom behavior specified in the `handler` object gets added. If we add a property to the `person` object, `set` will get invoked. If we access a property on the `person` object, `get` gets invoked.

First, we added a new property `name` to the proxy object (`person.name = "Lydia"`). `set` gets invoked, and logs `"Added a new property!"`.

Then, we access a property value on the proxy object, the `get` property on the handler object got invoked. `"Accessed a property!"` gets logged.

#### Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.

- C: `2` `Error` and `3` `6`
- D: `2` `4` and `3` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

First, we invoked `myFunc()` without passing any arguments. Since we didn't pass arguments, `num` and `value` got their default values: num is `2`, and `value` the returned value of the function `add`. To the `add` function, we pass `num` as an argument, which had the value of `2`. `add` returns `4`, which is the value of `value`.

Then, we invoked `myFunc(3)` and passed the value `3` as the value for the argument `num`. We didn't pass an argument for `value`. Since we didn't pass a value for the `value` argument, it got the default value: the returned value of the `add` function. To `add`, we pass `num`, which has the value of `3`. `add` returns `6`, which is the value of `value`.

In order to iterate over the `members` in each element in the `teams` array, we need to pass `teams[i].members` to the `getMembers` generator function. The generator function returns a generator object. In order to iterate over each element in this generator object, we need to use `yield*`.

If we would've written `yield`, `return yield`, or `return`, the entire generator function would've gotten returned the first time we called the `next` method.

- D: `["coding", "running", "dancing", "baking"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `addHobby` function receives two arguments, `hobby` and `hobbies` with the default value of the `hobbies` array on the `person` object.

First, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"running"` as the value for `hobby` and an empty array as the value for `hobbies`. Since we pass an empty array as the value for `y`, `"running"` gets added to this empty array.

Then, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"dancing"` as the value for `hobby`. We didn't pass a value for `hobbies`, so it gets the default value, the `hobbies` property on the `person` object. We push the hobby `dancing` to the `person.hobbies` array.

Last, we invoke the `addHobby` function, and pass `"baking"` as the value for `hobby`, and the `person.hobbies` array as the value for `hobbies`. We push the hobby `baking` to the `person.hobbies` array.

After pushing `dancing` and `baking`, the value of `person.hobbies` is `["coding", "dancing", "baking"]`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Objects aren't iterable by default. An iterable is an iterable if the iterator protocol is present. We can add this manually by adding the iterator symbol `[Symbol.iterator]`, which has to return a generator object, for example by making it a generator function `*[Symbol.iterator]() {}`. This generator function has to yield the `Object.values` of the `person` object if we want it to return the array `["Lydia Hallie", 21]`: `yield* Object.values(this)`.

###### 145. What's the output?

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach(num => {
	if (num) count += 1
})

console.log(count)
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `if` condition within the `forEach` loop checks whether the value of `num` is truthy or falsy. Since the first number in the `nums` array is `0`, a falsy value, the `if` statement's code block won't be executed. `count` only gets incremented for the other 3 numbers in the `nums` array, `1`, `2` and `3`. Since `count` gets incremented by `1` 3 times, the value of `count` is `3`.

###### 146. What's the output?

```javascript
function getFruit(fruits) {
	console.log(fruits?.[1]?.[1])
}

getFruit([['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']])
getFruit()
getFruit([['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']])
```

- A: `null`, `undefined`, 🍌
- B: `[]`, `null`, 🍌
- C: `[]`, `[]`, 🍌
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`, 🍌

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `?` allows us to optionally access deeper nested properties within objects. We're trying to log the item on index `1` within the subarray that's on index `1` of the `fruits` array. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array doesn't exist, it'll simply return `undefined`. If the subarray on index `1` in the `fruits` array exists, but this subarray doesn't have an item on its `1` index, it'll also return `undefined`. 

First, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍍']` subarray of `[['🍊', '🍌'], ['🍍']]`. This subarray only contains one item, which means there is no item on index `1`, and returns `undefined`.

Then, we're invoking the `getFruits` function without passing a value as an argument, which means that `fruits` has a value of `undefined` by default. Since we're conditionally chaining the item on index `1` of`fruits`, it returns `undefined` since this item on index `1` does not exist. 

Lastly, we're trying to log the second item in the `['🍊', '🍌']` subarray of `['🍍'], ['🍊', '🍌']`. The item on index `1` within this subarray is `🍌`, which gets logged.

###### 147. What's the output?

```javascript
class Calc {
	constructor() {
		this.count = 0 
	}

	increase() {
		this.count ++
	}
}

const calc = new Calc()
new Calc().increase()

console.log(calc.count)
```

- A: `0`
- B: `1`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `calc` equal to a new instance of the `Calc` class. Then, we instantiate a new instance of `Calc`, and invoke the `increase` method on this instance. Since the count property is within the constructor of the `Calc` class, the count property is not shared on the prototype of `Calc`. This means that the value of count has not been updated for the instance calc points to, count is still `0`.

###### 148. What's the output?

```javascript
const user = {
	email: "e@mail.com",
	password: "12345"
}

const updateUser = ({ email, password }) => {
	if (email) {
		Object.assign(user, { email })
	}

	if (password) {
		user.password = password
	}

	return user
}

const updatedUser = updateUser({ email: "new@email.com" })

console.log(updatedUser === user)
```

- A: `false`
- B: `true`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The `updateUser` function updates the values of the `email` and `password` properties on user, if their values are passed to the function, after which the function returns the `user` object. The returned value of the `updateUser` function is the `user` object, which means that the value of updatedUser is a reference to the same `user` object that `user` points to. `updatedUser === user` equals `true`.

###### 149. What's the output?

```javascript
const fruit = ['🍌', '🍊', '🍎']

fruit.slice(0, 1)
fruit.splice(0, 1)
fruit.unshift('🍇')

console.log(fruit)
```

- A: `['🍌', '🍊', '🍎']`
- B: `['🍊', '🍎']`
- C: `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`
- D: `['🍇', '🍌', '🍊', '🍎']`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

First, we invoke the `slice` method on the fruit array. The slice method does not modify the original array, but returns the value that it sliced off the array: the banana emoji.
Then, we invoke the `splice` method on the fruit array. The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of `['🍊', '🍎']`.
At last, we invoke the `unshift` method on the `fruit` array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, ‘🍇’ in this case,  as the first element in the array.  The fruit array now consists of `['🍇', '🍊', '🍎']`.

###### 150. What's the output?

```javascript
const animals = {};
let dog = { emoji: '🐶' }
let cat = { emoji: '🐈' }

animals[dog] = { ...dog, name: "Mara" }
animals[cat] = { ...cat, name: "Sara" }

console.log(animals[dog])
```

- A: `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara" }`
- B: `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

Object keys are converted to strings. 

Since the value of  `dog` is an object,  `animals[dog]` actually means that we’re creating a new property called `"object Object"` equal to the new object. `animals["object Object"]` is now equal to `{ emoji: "🐶", name: "Mara"}`.

`cat` is also an object, which means that `animals[cat]` actually means that we’re overwriting the value of  `animals[``"``object Object``"``]` with the new cat properties. 

Logging `animals[dog]`, or actually `animals["object Object"]` since converting the `dog` object to a string results `"object Object"`, returns the `{ emoji: "🐈", name: "Sara" }`.

###### 151. What's the output?

```javascript
const user = {
	email: "my@email.com",
	updateEmail: email => {
		this.email = email
	}
}

user.updateEmail("new@email.com")
console.log(user.email)
```

- A: `my@email.com`
- B: `new@email.com`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `updateEmail` function is an arrow function, and is not bound to the `user` object. This means that the `this` keyword is not referring to the `user` object, but refers to  the global scope in this case. The value of `email` within the `user` object does not get updated. When logging the value of `user.email`, the original value of `my@email.com` gets returned.

###### 152. What's the output?

```javascript
const promise1 = Promise.resolve('First')
const promise2 = Promise.resolve('Second')
const promise3 = Promise.reject('Third')
const promise4 = Promise.resolve('Fourth')

const runPromises = async () => {
	const res1 = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
	const res2  = await Promise.all([promise3, promise4])
	return [res1, res2]
}

runPromises()
	.then(res => console.log(res))
	.catch(err => console.log(err))
```

- A: `[['First', 'Second'], ['Fourth']]`
- B: `[['First', 'Second'], ['Third', 'Fourth']]`
- C: `[['First', 'Second']]`
- D: `'Third'`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The `Promise.all` method runs the passed promises in parallel. If one promise fails, the `Promise.all` method _rejects_ with the value of the rejected promise. In this case, `promise3` rejected with the value `"Third"`. We’re catching the rejected value in the chained `catch` method on the `runPromises` invocation to catch any errors  within the `runPromises` function. Only `"Third"` gets logged, since `promise3` rejected with this value.

###### 153. What should the value of `method` be to log `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`? 

```javascript
const keys = ["name", "age"]
const values = ["Lydia", 22]

const method = /* ?? */
Object[method](keys.map((_, i) => {
	return [keys[i], values[i]]
})) // { name: "Lydia", age: 22 }
```

- A: `entries`
- B: `values`
- C: `fromEntries`
- D: `forEach`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `fromEntries` method turns a 2d array into an object. The first element in each subarray will be the key, and the second element in each subarray will be the value. In this case, we’re mapping over the `keys` array, which returns an array which first element is the item on the key array on the current index, and the second element is the item of the values array on the current index. 

This creates an array of subarrays containing the correct keys and values, which results in `{ name: "Lydia", age: 22 }`

###### 154. What's the output?

```javascript
const createMember = ({ email, address = {}}) => {
	const validEmail = /.+\@.+\..+/.test(email)
	if (!validEmail) throw new Error("Valid email pls")

	return {
		email,
		address: address ? address : null
	}
}

const member = createMember({ email: "my@email.com" })
console.log(member)
```

- A: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: null }`
- B: `{ email: "my@email.com" }`
- C: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: {} }`
- D: `{ email: "my@email.com", address: undefined }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The default value of `address` is an empty object `{}`. When we set the variable `member` equal to the object returned by the `createMember` function, we didn't pass a value for address, which means that the value of address is the default empty object `{}`. An empty object is a truthy value, which means that the condition of the `address ? address : null` conditional returns `true`. The value of address is the empty object `{}`.

###### 155. What's the output?

```javascript
let randomValue = { name: "Lydia" }
randomValue = 23

if (!typeof randomValue === "string") {
	console.log("It's not a string!")
} else {
	console.log("Yay it's a string!")
}
```

- A: `It's not a string!`
- B: `Yay it's a string!`
- C: `TypeError`
- D: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

The condition within the `if` statement checks whether the value of `!typeof randomValue` is equal to `"string"`. The `!` operator converts the value to a boolean value. If the value is truthy, the returned value will be `false`, if the value is falsy, the returned value will be `true`. In this case, the returned value of `typeof randomValue` is the truthy value `"number"`, meaning that the value of `!typeof randomValue` is the boolean value `false`.

`!typeof randomValue === "string"` always returns false, since we're actually checking `false === "string"`. Since the condition returned `false`, the code block of the `else` statement gets run, and `Yay it's a string!` gets logged.

## Introduction

Code reviews can inspire dread in both reviewer and reviewee. Having your
code analyzed can feel as invasive and uncomfortable. Even worse, reviewing other 
people's code can feel like a painful and ambiguous exercise, searching 
for problems and not even knowing where to begin.

This project aims to provide some solid tips for how to review the code that
you and your team write. All examples are written in JavaScript, but the advice
should be applicable to any project of any language. This is by no means an
exhaustive list, but hopefully this will help you catch as many bugs as
possible long before users ever see your feature.

## Why Review Code?

Code reviews are a necessary part of the software engineering process because
you alone can't catch every problem in a piece of code you
write. That's ok though! Even the best basketball players in the world miss
shots.

Having others review our work ensures that we deliver the best product to users
and with the least amount of errors. Make sure your team implements a code
review process for new code that is introduced into your codebase. Find a
process that works for you and your team. There's no one size fits all. The
important point is to do code reviews as regularly as possible.

## Basics

### Code reviews should be as automated as possible

Avoid discussing details that can be handled by a static analysis tool. Don't
argue about nuances such as code formatting and whether to use `let` or `var`.
Having a formatter and linter can save your team a lot of time from reviews
that your computer can do for you.

### Code reviews should avoid API discussion

These discussions should happen before the code is even written. Don't try to
argue about the floor plan once you've poured the concrete
foundation.

### Code reviews should be kind

It's scary to have your code reviewed and it can bring about feelings of
insecurity in even the most experienced developer. Be positive in your language
and keep your teammates comfortable and secure in their work!

## Readability

### Typos should be corrected

Avoid nitpicking as much as you can and save it for your linter, compiler, and
formatter. When you can't, such as in the case of typos, leave a kind comment
suggesting a fix. It's the little things that make a big difference sometimes!

### Variable and function names should be clear

Naming is one of the hardest problems in computer science. We've all given names
to variables, functions, and files that are confusing. Help your teammate out
by suggesting a clearer name, if the one you're reading doesn't make sense.

```javascript
// This function could be better named as namesToUpperCase
function u(names) {
  // ...
}
```

### Functions should be short

Functions should do one thing! Long functions usually mean that they are doing
too much. Tell your teammate to split out the function into multiple different
ones.

```javascript
// This is both emailing clients and deciding which are active. Should be
// 2 different functions.
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

### Files should be cohesive, and ideally short

Just like functions, a file should be about one thing. A file represents a
module and a module should do one thing for your codebase.

For example, if your module is called `fake-name-generator` it should just be
responsible for creating fake names like "Keyser Söze". If the
`fake-name-generator` also includes a bunch of utility functions for querying a
database of names, that should be in a separate module.

There's no rule for how long a file should be, but if it's long like below **and**
includes functions that don't relate to one another, then it should probably
be split apart.

```javascript
// Line 1
import _ from 'lodash';
function generateFakeNames() {
  // ..
}

// Line 1128
function queryRemoteDatabase() {
  // ...
}
```

### Exported functions should be documented

If your function is intended to be used by other libraries, it helps to add
documentation so users of it know what it does.

```javascript
// This needs documentation. What is this function for? How is it used?
export function networkMonitor(graph, duration, failureCallback) {
  // ...
}
```

### Complex code should be commented

If you have named things well and the logic is still confusing, then it's time
for a comment.

```javascript
function leftPad(str, len, ch) {
  str = str + '';
  len = len - str.length;

  while (true) {
    // This needs a comment, why a bitwise and here?
    if (len & 1) pad += ch;
    // This needs a comment, why a bit shift here?
    len >>= 1;
    if (len) ch += ch;
    else break;
  }

  return pad + str;
}
```

## Side Effects

### Functions should be as pure as possible

```javascript
// Global variable is referenced by the following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it
// could break it. Instead it's better to pass in a name parameter
let name = 'Ryan McDermott';

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(' ');
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();
```

### I/O functions should have failure cases handled

Any function that does I/O should handle when something goes wrong

```javascript
function getIngredientsFromFile() {
  const onFulfilled = buffer => {
    let lines = buffer.split('\n');
    return lines.forEach(line => <Ingredient ingredient={line} />);
  };

  // What about when this rejected because of an error? What do we return?
  return readFile('./ingredients.txt').then(onFulfilled);
}
```

## Limits

### Null cases should be handled

If you have a list component for example, all is well and good if you display a
nice beautiful table that shows all its data. Your users love it and you get a
promotion! But what happens when no data comes back? What do you show in the
null case? Your code should be resilient to every case that can occur. If
there's something bad that can happen in your code, eventually it will happen.

```javascript
class InventoryList {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Product</th>
          </tr>
          // We should show something for the null case here if there's // nothing
          in the data inventory
          {Object.keys(this.data.inventory).map(itemId => (
            <tr key={i}>
              <td>{itemId}</td>

              <td>{this.state.inventory[itemId].product}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    );
  }
}
```

### Large cases should be handled

In the list above, what would happen if 10,000 items came back from the
inventory? In that case, you need some form of pagination or infinite scroll.
Be sure to always assess the potential edge cases in terms of volume, especially
when it comes to UI programming.

### Singular cases should be handled

```javascript
class MoneyDislay {
  constructor(amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
  }

  render() {
    // What happens if the user has 1 dollar? You can't say plural "dollars"
    return (
      <div className="fancy-class">
        You have {this.amount} dollars in your account
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### User input should be limited

Users can potentially input an unlimited amount of data to send to you. It's
important to set limits if a function takes any kind of user data in.

```javascript
router.route('/message').post((req, res) => {
  const message = req.body.content;

  // What happens if the message is many megabytes of data? Do we want to store
  // that in the database? We should set limits on the size.
  db.save(message);
});
```

### Functions should handle unexpected user input

Users will always surprise you with the data they give you. Don't expect that
you will always get the right type of data or even any data in a request from a
user. [And don't rely on client-side validation alone](https://twitter.com/ryconoclast/status/885523459748487169)

```javascript
router.route('/transfer-money').post((req, res) => {
  const amount = req.body.amount;
  const from = user.id;
  const to = req.body.to;

  // What happens if we got a string instead of a number as our amount? This
  // function would fail
  transferMoney(from, to, amount);
});
```

## Security

Data security is the most important aspect of your application. If users can't
trust you with their data, then you won't have a business. There are numerous
different types of security exploits that can plague an app, depending on the
particular language and runtime environment. Below is a very small and
incomplete list of common security problems. Don't rely on this alone! Automate
as much security review as you can on every commit, and perform routine security
audits.

### XSS should not be possible

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the largest vectors for security attacks
on a web application. It occurs when you take user data and include it in your
page without first properly sanitizing it. This can cause your site to execute
source code from remote pages.

```javascript
function getBadges() {
  let badge = document.getElementsByClassName('badge');
  let nameQueryParam = getQueryParams('name');

  /**
   * What if nameQueryParam was `<script>sendCookie(document.cookie)</script>`?
   * If that was the query param, a malicious user could lure a user to click a
   * link with that as the `name` query param, and have the user unknowingly
   * send their data to a bad actor.
   */
  badge.children[0].innerHTML = nameQueryParam;
}
```

### Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should not leak

You bear an enormous weight of responsibility every time you take in user data.
If you leak data in URLs, in analytics tracking to third parties, or even expose
data to employees that shouldn't have access, you greatly hurt your users and
your business. Be careful with other people's lives!

```javascript
router.route('/bank-user-info').get((req, res) => {
  const name = user.name;
  const id = user.id;
  const socialSecurityNumber = user.ssn;

  // There's no reason to send a socialSecurityNumber back in a query parameter
  // This would be exposed in the URL and potentially to any middleman on the
  // network watching internet traffic
  res.addToQueryParams({
    name,
    id,
    socialSecurityNumber
  });
});
```

## Performance

### Functions should use efficient algorithms and data structures

This is different for every particular case, but use your best judgment to see
if there are any ways to improve the efficiency of a piece of code. Your users
will thank you for the faster speeds!

```javascript
// If mentions was a hash data structure, you wouldn't need to iterate through
// all mentions to find a user. You could simply return the presence of the
// user key in the mentions hash
function isUserMentionedInComments(mentions, user) {
  let mentioned = false;
  mentions.forEach(mention => {
    if (mention.user === user) {
      mentioned = true;
    }
  });

  return mentioned;
}
```

### Important actions should be logged

Logging helps give metrics about performance and insight into user behavior.
Not every action needs to be logged, but decide with your team what makes sense
to keep track of for data analytics. And be sure that no personally identifiable
information is exposed!

```javascript
router.route('/request-ride').post((req, res) => {
  const currentLocation = req.body.currentLocation;
  const destination = req.body.destination;

  requestRide(user, currentLocation, destination).then(result => {
    // We should log before and after this block to get a metric for how long
    // this task took, and potentially even what locations were involved in ride
    // ...
  });
});
```

## Testing

### New code should be tested

All new code should include a test, whether it fixes a bug, or is a new feature.
If it's a bug fix, it should have a test proving that the bug is fixed. And if
it's a new feature, then every component should be unit tested and there should
be an integration test ensuring that the feature works with the rest of the
system.

### Tests should actually test all of what the function does

```javascript
function payEmployeeSalary(employeeId, amount, callback) {
  db.get('EMPLOYEES', employeeId)
    .then(user => {
      return sendMoney(user, amount);
    })
    .then(res => {
      if (callback) {
        callback(res);
      }

      return res;
    });
}

const callback = res => console.log('called', res);
const employee = createFakeEmployee('john jacob jingleheimer schmidt');
const result = payEmployeeSalary(employee.id, 1000, callback);
assert(result.status === enums.SUCCESS);
// What about the callback? That should be tested
```

### Tests should stress edge cases and limits of a function

```javascript
function dateAddDays(dateTime, day) {
  // ...
}

let dateTime = '1/1/2017';
let date1 = dateAddDays(dateTime, 5);

assert(date1 === '1/6/2017');

// What happens if we add negative days?
// What happens if we add fractional days: 1.2, 8.7, etc.
// What happens if we add 1 billion days?
```

## Miscellaneous

> _"Everything can be filed under miscellaneous"_

> George Bernard Shaw

### TODO comments should be tracked

TODO comments are great for letting you and your fellow engineers know that something
needs to be fixed later. Sometimes you gotta ship code and wait to fix it
later. But eventually you'll have to clean it up! That's why you should track it
and give a corresponding ID from your issue tracking system so you can schedule
it and keep track of where the problem is in your codebase.

### Commit messages should be clear and accurately describe new code

We've all written commit messages like "Changed some crap", "damn it",
"ugg one more to fix this stupid bug". These are funny and satisfying, but not
helpful when you're up on a Saturday morning because you pushed code on a Friday
night and can't figure out what the bad code was doing when you `git blamed` the
commit. Write commit messages that describe the code accurately, and include
a ticket number from your issue tracking system if you have one. That will make
searching through your commit log much easier.

### The code should do what it's supposed to do

This seems obvious, but most reviewers don't have the time or take the time to
manually test every user-facing change. It's important to make sure the business
logic of every change is as per design. It's easy to forget that when you're
just looking for problems in the code!

# Hiring Without Whiteboards

A list of companies (or teams) that don't do "whiteboard" interviews. "Whiteboards" is used as a metaphor, and is a _symbol_ for the kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview practices. Whiteboards are not bad – CS trivia questions are. Using sites like HackerRank/LeetCode _probably_ fall into a similar category.

The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to) [our recommendations](RECOMMENDATIONS.md) for ways to conduct better interviews.

### tl;dr
- Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is 👍
- Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or without whiteboard) is 👎

### Creating a clean gh-pages branch

This is the sequence of steps to follow to create a root `gh-pages` branch. It is based on a question at [SO]

``` {shell}
cd /path/to/repo-name
git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx
echo "My GitHub Page" > index.html
git add .
git commit -a -m "First pages commit"
git push origin gh-pages
```

Why do we need to do all this, instead of just calling `git branch gh-pages`. Well, if you are at master and you do `git branch gh-pages`, gh-pages will be based off master.

Here, the intention is to create a branch for github pages, which is typically not associated with the history of your repo (master and other branches) and hence the usage of git symbolic-ref. This creates a "root branch", which is one without a previous history.

Note that it is also called an orphan branch and `git checkout --orphan` will now do the same thing as the `git symbolic-ref` that was being done before. Check out this question on [SO2] as well.

### [_CONTAINER/deploy-react-2-heroku/Deploy-React-App-2-Heroku.md](_CONTAINER/deploy-react-2-heroku/Deploy-React-App-2-Heroku.md)


Heroku is an web application that makes deploying applications easy for a beginner.

Before you begin deploying, **make sure to remove any `console.log`'s or `debugger`'s in any production code**. You can search your entire project folder if you are using them anywhere.

You will set up Heroku to run on a production, not development, version of your application. When a Node.js application like yours is pushed up to Heroku, it is identified as a Node.js application because of the `package.json` file. It runs `npm install` automatically. Then, if there is a `heroku-postbuild` script in the `package.json` file, it will run that script. Afterwards, it will automatically run `npm start`.

In the following phases, you will configure your application to work in production, not just in development, and configure the `package.json` scripts for `install`, `heroku-postbuild` and `start` scripts to install, build your React application, and start the Express production server.

Phase 1: Heroku Connection
--------------------------

If you haven't created a Heroku account yet, create one [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

Add a new application in your [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) named whatever you want. Under the "Resources" tab in your new application, click "Find more add-ons" and add the "Heroku Postgres" add-on with the free Hobby Dev setting.

In your terminal, install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line). Afterwards, login to Heroku in your terminal by running the following:

    heroku login

Add Heroku as a remote to your project's git repository in the following command and replace `<name-of-Heroku-app>` with the name of the application you created in the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/).

    heroku git:remote -a <name-of-Heroku-app>

Next, you will set up your Express + React application to be deployable to Heroku.

Phase 2: Setting up your Express + React application
----------------------------------------------------

Right now, your React application is on a different localhost port than your Express application. However, since your React application only consists of static files that don't need to bundled continuously with changes in production, your Express application can serve the React assets in production too. These static files live in the `frontend/build` folder after running `npm run build` in the `frontend` folder.

Add the following changes into your `backend/routes.index.js` file.

At the root route, serve the React application's static `index.html` file along with `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie. Then serve up all the React application's static files using the `express.static` middleware. Serve the `index.html` and set the `XSRF-TOKEN` cookie again on all routes that don't start in `/api`. You should already have this set up in `backend/routes/index.js` which should now look like this:

    // backend/routes/index.js
    const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();
    const apiRouter = require('./api');
    
    router.use('/api', apiRouter);
    
    // Static routes
    // Serve React build files in production
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
      const path = require('path');
      // Serve the frontend's index.html file at the root route
      router.get('/', (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.sendFile(
          path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
        );
      });
    
      // Serve the static assets in the frontend's build folder
      router.use(express.static(path.resolve("../frontend/build")));
    
      // Serve the frontend's index.html file at all other routes NOT starting with /api
      router.get(/^(?!\/?api).*/, (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.sendFile(
          path.resolve(__dirname, '../../frontend', 'build', 'index.html')
        );
      });
    }
    
    // Add a XSRF-TOKEN cookie in development
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
      router.get('/api/csrf/restore', (req, res) => {
        res.cookie('XSRF-TOKEN', req.csrfToken());
        res.status(201).json({});
      });
    }
    
    module.exports = router;

Your Express backend's `package.json` should include scripts to run the `sequelize` CLI commands.

The `backend/package.json`'s scripts should now look like this:

      "scripts": {
        "sequelize": "sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "sequelize-cli",
        "start": "per-env",
        "start:development": "nodemon -r dotenv/config ./bin/www",
        "start:production": "node ./bin/www"
      },

Initialize a `package.json` file at the very root of your project directory (outside of both the `backend` and `frontend` folders). The scripts defined in this `package.json` file will be run by Heroku, not the scripts defined in the `backend/package.json` or the `frontend/package.json`.

When Heroku runs `npm install`, it should install packages for both the `backend` and the `frontend`. Overwrite the `install` script in the root `package.json` with:

    npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend

This will run `npm install` in the `backend` folder then run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder.

Next, define a `heroku-postbuild` script that will run the `npm run build` command in the `frontend` folder. Remember, Heroku will automatically run this script after running `npm install`.

Define a `sequelize` script that will run `npm run sequelize` in the `backend` folder.

Finally, define a `start` that will run `npm start` in the \`backend folder.

The root `package.json`'s scripts should look like this:

      "scripts": {
        "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build --prefix frontend",
        "install": "npm --prefix backend install backend && npm --prefix frontend install frontend",
        "dev:backend": "npm install --prefix backend start",
        "dev:frontend": "npm install --prefix frontend start",
        "sequelize": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize",
        "sequelize-cli": "npm run --prefix backend sequelize-cli",
        "start": "npm start --prefix backend"
      },

The `dev:backend` and `dev:frontend` scripts are optional and will not be used for Heroku.

Finally, commit your changes.

Phase 3: Deploy to Heroku
-------------------------

Once you're finished setting this up, navigate to your application's Heroku dashboard. Under "Settings" there is a section for "Config Vars". Click the `Reveal Config Vars` button to see all your production environment variables. You should have a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable already from the Heroku Postgres add-on.

Add environment variables for `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` and `JWT_SECRET` and any other environment variables you need for production.

You can also set environment variables through the Heroku CLI you installed earlier in your terminal. See the docs for [Setting Heroku Config Variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).

Push your project to Heroku. Heroku only allows the `master` branch to be pushed. But, you can alias your branch to be named `master` when pushing to Heroku. For example, to push a branch called `login-branch` to `master` run:

    git push heroku login-branch:master

If you do want to push the `master` branch, just run:

    git push heroku master

You may want to make two applications on Heroku, the `master` branch site that should have working code only. And your `staging` site that you can use to test your work in progress code.

Now you need to migrate and seed your production database.

Using the Heroku CLI, you can run commands inside of your production application just like in development using the `heroku run` command.

For example to migrate the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:migrate

To seed the production database, run:

    heroku run npm run sequelize db:seed:all

Note: You can interact with your database this way as you'd like, but beware that `db:drop` **cannot** be run in the Heroku environment. If you want to drop and create the database, you need to remove and add back the "Heroku Postgres" add-on.

Another way to interact with the production application is by opening a bash shell through your terminal by running:

    heroku bash

In the opened shell, you can run things like `npm run sequelize db:migrate`.

Open your deployed site and check to see if you successfully deployed your Express + React application to Heroku!

If you see an `Application Error` or are experiencing different behavior than what you see in your local environment, check the logs by running:

    heroku logs

If you want to open a connection to the logs to continuously output to your terminal, then run:

    heroku logs --tail

The logs may clue you into why you are experiencing errors or different behavior.

### Wrapping up

You can also open your site in the browser with `heroku open`. If it works, congratulations, you've created a production-ready, dynamic, full-stack website that can be securely accessed anywhere in the world! Give yourself a pat on the back. You're a web developer!

### [_CONTAINER/deploy-static-2-heroku/deploy-static-sties-2-heroku.md](_CONTAINER/deploy-static-2-heroku/deploy-static-sties-2-heroku.md)
Gist
This is a quick tutorial explaining how to get a static website hosted on Heroku.

Why do this?

Heroku hosts apps on the internet, not static websites. To get it to run your static portfolio, personal blog, etc., you need to trick Heroku into thinking your website is a PHP app. This 6-step tutorial will teach you how.

Basic Assumptions
You want to deploy some straight-up HTML, CSS, JS, maybe a few images. Nothing fancy here.
You are in the root directory of your site (i.e. the directory that contains all subdirectories and files for the site)
The root directory contains a main HTML page, e.g. index.html
A Heroku app and remote are set up and ready to go
Steps
Add a file called composer.json to the root directory by running touch composer.json
Add a file called index.php to the root directory by running touch index.php
Rename the homepage (e.g. index.html) to home.html
In index.php, add the following line: <?php include_once("home.html"); ?>
In composer.json, add the following line: {}
Run git push heroku master
Done! Visit your deployed single-page website, hosted by Heroku (as a fake PHP app ☺).

### [_CONTAINER/detect-device-typ/regex-cheatsheet.md](_CONTAINER/detect-device-typ/regex-cheatsheet.md)
## Basic definitions

- String `s` *matches* the regex pattern `/p/` whenever `s` contains the pattern 'p'.
    - Example: `abc` matches `/a/`, `/b/`, `/c/`
- For simplicity, we will use the *matches* verb loosely in a sense that
    - a string can *match* a regex (e.g. 'a' matches /a/)
    - a regex can *match* a string (e.g. /a/ matches 'a')
- A regex pattern consists of *literal characters* that match itself, and *metasyntax characters* 
- Literal characters can be *concatenated* in a regular expression. String `s` matches `/ab/` if there is an `a` character *directly followed by a `b` character.
    - Example: `abc` matches `/ab/`, `/bc/`, `/abc/`
    - Example: `abc` does not match `/ac/`, `/cd/`, `/abcd/`
- *Alternative execution* can be achieved with the metasyntax character `|`
    - `/a|b/` means: match either `a` or `b`
    - Example: 'ac', 'b', 'ab' match `/a|b/`
    - Example: 'c' does not match `/a|b/`
- Iteration is achieved using repeat modifiers. One repeat modifier is the `*` (asterisk) metasyntax character. 
    - Example: `/a*/` matches any string containing any number of `a` characters
    - Example: `/a*/` matches any string, including `''`, because they all contain at least zero `a` characters
- Matching is *greedy*. A *greedy* match attempts to stay in iterations as long as possible. 
    - Example: `s = 'baaa'` matches `/a*a/` in the following way:
        - `s[0]`: `'b'` is discarded
        - `s[1]`: `'a'` matches the pattern `a*`
        - `s[1] - s[2]`: `'aa'` matches the pattern `a*`
        - `s[1] - s[3]`: `'aaa'` matches the pattern `a*`
        - as there are no more characters in `s` and there is a character yet to be matched in the regex, we *backtrack* one character
        - `s[1] - s[2]`: `'aa'` matches the pattern `a*`, and we end investigating the `a*` pattern
        - `s[3]`: `'a'` matches the `a` pattern
        - there is a complete match, `s[1] - s[2]` match the `a*` pattern, and `s[3]` matches the `a` pattern. The returned match is `aaa` starting at index `1` of string `s`
- Backtracking is *minimal*. We attempt to backtrack one character at a time in the string, and attempt to interpret the rest of the regex pattern on the remainder of the string.


## Constructing a regex

* literal form: `/regex/`
* constructor: `new RegExp( 'regex' );`
    - escaping: `/\d/` becomes `new RegExp( '\\d' )`
    - argument list: `new RegExp( pattern, modifiers );`

Applying modifiers in literal form: 
```
const regex1 = new RegExp( 'regex', 'ig' );
const regex2 = /regex/ig;
```

* `RegExp` constructor also accepts a regular expression:

```
> new RegExp( /regex/, 'i' );
/regex/i
```

## List of JavaScript regex modifiers

| Modifier | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `i`      | non-case sensitive matching. Upper and lower cases don't matter.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `g`      | global match. We attempt to find all matches instead of just returning the first match. The internal state of the regular expression stores where the last match was located, and matching is resumed where it was left in the previous match. |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `m`      | multiline match. It treats the `^` and `$` characters to match the beginning and the end of each line of the tested string. A newline character is determined by `\n` or `\r`.                                                                 |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `u`      | unicode search. The regex pattern is treated as a unicode sequence                                                                                                                                                                             |
|          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `y`      | Sticky search                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Example:

```
> const str = 'Regular Expressions';

> /re/.test( str );
false
> /re/i.test( str ); // matches: 're', 'Re', 'rE', 'RE'
true
```  

## Regex API

- `regex.exec( str )`: returns information on the first match. Exec allows iteration on the regex for all matches if the `g` modifier is set for the regex
- `regex.test( str )`: true iff regex *matches* a string

```
> const regex = /ab/;
> const str = 'bbababb';
> const noMatchStr = 'c';

> regex.exec( str ); // first match is at index 2
[ 0: "ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb" ]
> regex.exec( noMatchStr );
null

> regex.test( str );
true
> regex.test( noMatchStr );
false

> regex.exec( noMatchStr );

> const globalRegex = /ab/g;
> globalRegex.exec( str );
> globalRegex.exec( str );
[ 0: "ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb" ]
> globalRegex.exec( str );
[ 0: "ab", index: 4, input: "bbababb" ]
> globalRegex.exec( str );
null

> let result;
> while ( ( result = globalRegex.exec( str ) ) !== null ) {
      console.log( result );
  }
[ 0: "ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb" ]
[ 0: "ab", index: 4, input: "bbababb" ]  
```

## String API

- `str.match( regex )`: for non-global regular expression arguments, it returns the same return value as `regex.exec( str )`. For global regular expressions, the return value is an array containing all the matches. Returns `null` if no match has been found.
- `str.replace( regex, newString )`: replaces the first full match with `newString`. If `regex` has a global modifier, `str.replace( regex, newString )` replaces all matches with `newString`. Does not mutate the original string `str`.
- `str.search( regex )`: returns the index of the first match. Returns `-1` when no match is found. Does not consider the global modifier.
- `str.split( regex )`: does not consider the global modifier. Returns an array of strings containing strings in-between matches.

```
> const regex = /ab/;
> const str = 'bbababb';
> const noMatchStr = 'c';

> str.match( regex );
["ab", index: 2, input: "bbababb"]

> str.match( globalRegex );
["ab", "ab"]

> noMatchStr.match( globalRegex );
null

> str.replace( regex, 'X' );
"bbXabb"

> str.replace( globalRegex, 'X' )
"bbXXb"

> str.search( regex );
2

> noMatchStr.search( regex );
-1

> str.split( regex );
["bb", "", "b"]

> noMatchStr.split( regex );
["c"]
```

## Literal characters

A regex *literal character* matches itself. The expression `/a/` matches any string that contains the `a` character. Example:

```
/a/.test( 'Andrea' )   // true, because the last character is 'a'
/a/.test( 'André' )    // false, because there is no 'a' in the string
/a/i.test( 'André')    // true, because 'A' matches /a/i with the case-insensitive flag `i` applied on `/a/`
```

Literal characters are: all characters except metasyntax characters such as: `.`, `*`, `^`, `$`, `[`, `]`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `|`, `?`, `+`, `\`

When you need a metasyntax character, place a backslash in front of it. Examples: `\.`, `\\`, `\[`.

Whitespaces:
- behave as literal characters, exact match is required
- use character classes for more flexibility, such as:
    - `\n` for a newline
    - `\t` for a tab
    - `\b` for word boundaries 

## Metasyntax characters

| `\1`, `\2`, ...      | backreference. `\i` is a reference to the matched contents of the *i*th capture group.                                                                                                                           |



Examples:

```
/.../.test( 'ab' )  // false, we need at least three arbitrary characters
/.a*/.test( 'a' )   // true, . matches 'a', and a* matches ''
/^a/.test( 'ba' )   // false, 'ba' does not start with a
/^a/.test( 'ab' )   // true, 'ab' starts with a
/a$/.test( 'ba' )   // true, 'ba' ends with a
/a$/.test( 'ab' )   // false, 'ab' does not end with a
/^a$/.test( 'ab' )  // false, 'ab' does not fully match a
/^a*$/.test( 'aa' ) // true, 'aa' fully matches a pattern consisting of
                    // a characters only
/[ab]/.test( 'b' )  // true, 'b' contains a character that is a
                    // member of the character class `[ab]`
/a|b/.test( 'b' )   // true, 'b' contains a character that is 
                    // either `a` or `b`
/ba?b/.test( 'bb' ) // true, the optional a is not included
/ba?b/.test( 'bab') // true, the optional a is included
/ba?b/.test( 'bcb') // false, only matches 'bb' or 'bab'
/a+/.test( '' )     // false, at least one `a` character is needed
/a+/.test( 'ba' )   // true, the `a` character was found
/a{3}/.test('baaab')// true, three consecutive 'a' characters were found  
/(a|b)c/.test('abc')// true, a `b` character is followed by `c`
/a(?=b)/.test('ab') // true. It matches 'a', because 'a' is followed by 'b'
/a(?!b)/.test('ab') // false, because 'a' is not followed by 'b'
/\ba/.test('bab')   // false, because 'a' is not the first character of a word
/\Ba/.test('bab')   // true, because 'a' is not the first character of a word
/(\d)\1/.test('55') // true. It matches two consecutive digits with the same value
```

In the last example, notice the parentheses. As the `|` operator has the lowest precedence out of all operators, parentheses made it possible to increase the prcedence of the alternative execution `a|b` higher than concatenation `(a|b)c`.

## Character sets, character classes

- `[abc]` is `a|b|c`
- `[a-c]` is `[abc]`
- `[0-9a-fA-F]` is a case-insensitive hexadecimal digit
- `[^abc]` is an arbitrary character that is not `a`, not `b`, and not `c`
- `.`: arbitrary character class
    - Example: `/..e/`: three character sequence ending with `e`
- other character classes such as digit (`\d`), not a digit (`\D`), word (`\w`), not a word (`\W`), whitespace character (`\s`): check out the section on metasyntax characters

## Basic (greedy) Repeat modifiers

Matching is maximal. Backtracking is minimal, goes character by character. 

| Repeat modifier | Description                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `+`             | Match at least once                                 |
|                 |                                                     |
| `?`             | Match at most once                                  |
|                 |                                                     |
| `*`             | Match any number of times                           |
|                 |                                                     |
| `{min,max}`     | match at least `min` times, and at most `max` times |
|                 |                                                     |
| `{n}`           | Match exactly `n` times                             |

Examples:

- `/^a+$/` matches any string consisting of one or more `'a'` characters and nothing else
- `/^a?$/` matches `''` or `'a'`. The string may contain at most one `'a'` character
- `/^a*$/` matches the empty string and everything matched by `/^a+$/`
- `/^a{3,5}$/` matches `'aaa'`, `'aaaa'`, and `'aaaaa'`
- `/(ab){3}/` matches any string containing the substring `'ababab'`

## Lazy Repeat Modifiers

Matching is minimal. During backtracking, we add one character at a time.

| `??`                   | Match at most once                                  |
|                        |                                                     |
| `*?`                   | Match any number of times                           |
|                        |                                                     |
| `{min,max}?`           | match at least `min` times, and at most `max` times |
|                        |                                                     |
| `{n}?`                 | Match exactly `n` times                             |

Examples for lazy matching:

- `/^a+?$/` lazily matches any string consisting of one or more `'a'` characters and nothing else
- `/^a??$/` lazily matches `''` or `'a'`. The string may contain at most one `'a'` character
- `/^a*?$/` lazily matches the empty string and everything matched by `/^a+$/`
- `/^a{3,5}?$/` lazily matches `'aaa'`, `'aaaa'`, and `'aaaaa'`
- `/(ab){3}?/` lazily matches any string containing the substring `'ababab'`

## Capture groups

- `(` and `)` captures a substring inside a regex
- Capture groups have a reference number equal to the order of the starting parentheses of the open parentheses of the capture group starting with `1`
- `(?:` and `)` act as non-capturing parentheses, they are not included in the capture group numbering

Example:

```
/a(b|c(d|(e))(f))$/
  ^   ^  ^   ^
  |   |  |   |
  1   2  3   4
```

```
> console.table( /^a(b|c(d|(e))(f+))$/.exec( 'ab' ) )  
(index) Value
0       "ab"
1       "b"
2       undefined
3       undefined
4       undefined
index   0
input   "ab"

> console.table( /^a(b|c(d|(e))(f+))$/.exec( 'aceff' ) )  
(index) Value
0       "aceff"
1       "ceff"
2       "e"
3       "e"
4       "ff"
index   0
input   "aceff"

> console.table( /^a(b|c(?:d|(e))(f+))$/.exec( 'aceff' ) )  
(index) Value
0       "aceff"
1       "ceff"
2       "e"
3       "ff"
index   0
input   "aceff"
```

## Lookahead and Lookbehind

| Lookahead type       | JavaScript syntax | Remark                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| positive lookahead   | `(?=pattern)`     |                                       |
| negative lookahead   | `(?!pattern)`     |                                       |
| positive lookbehind  | `(?<=pattern)`    | only expected in ES2018               |
| negative lookbehind  | `(?<!pattern)`    | only expected in ES2018               |
| word boundary        | `\b`              | used both as lookahead and lookbehind |
| start of string/line | `^`               | used as a lookbehind                  |
| end of string/line   | `$`               | used as a lookbehind                  |

- Lookaheads and lookbehinds are non-capturing
- Opposed to Perl 5, lookbehinds can be of variable length, because matching is implemented backwards. This means no restrictions in lookbehind length
    - as a consequence of backwards matching, using capture groups inside lookbehinds are evaluated according to the rules of backwards matching

Examples:

```
> /a(?=b)/.exec( 'ab' )
["a", index: 0, input: "ab"]

> /a(?!\d)/.exec( 'ab' )
["a", index: 0, input: "ab"]
> /a(?!\d)/.exec( 'a0' )
null

> /(?<=a)b/.exec( 'ab' )
["b", index: 1, input: "ab"] // executed in latest Google Chrome

/(?<!a)b/.exec( 'Ab' )
["b", index: 1, input: "Ab"] // executed in latest Google Chrome

/\bregex\b/.exec( 'This regex expression tests word boundaries.' )
["regex", index: 5, input: "This regex expression tests word boundaries."]

/^regex$/.exec( 'This\nregex\nexpression\ntests\nanchors.' )
null

/^regex$/m.exec( 'This\nregex\nexpression\ntests\nanchors.' )
["regex", index: 5, input: "This↵regex↵expression↵tests↵anchors."]
```

## Possessive Repeat Modifiers

Attempts a maximal (greedy) match first. The loop does not backtrack though. It either accepts the maximal match, or fails.

Possessive repeat modifiers don't exist in JavaScript. However, there are workarounds.

Assuming we don't have any other capture groups in front of the expression, use 
- `(?=(a+))\1` instead of the generic PCRE pattern `a++` 
- `(?=(a*))\1` instead of the generic PCRE pattern `a*+`
- etc.

# How to use Docker build secrets

It's common to need access to secret data to fully build an application from scratch. Commonly, builds pull sources or binaries from a private repository that requires authentication - private PyPI, npm, NuGet, etc. It's also common to use a Dockerfile to perform application build and packaging when deploying apps as containers, to take advantage of an isolated environment. This presents a challenge, as we don't want any secrets (files, environment variables, etc) to be captured in our image layers.

Docker 18.09 added some [nice build enhancements](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/#new-docker-build-secret-information), including a feature called build secrets, that help us solve just this. The idea is simple: mount a volume at build time, use it in a `RUN` command, then don't include it in our final image.

## An example

This is an example of using build secrets with Python to pull from a private package repository. I'm using this [simple_package](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-pipelines-python/tree/master/src/simple_package) and I'm also making the assumption that if you're reading this post, you have this problem and you already know how to build a Python package & upload it to a repository somewhere.

### TL;DR:

Run this, study the annotations as needed

```bash
# Pass the path to your pip.conf (secret) and build an image
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --secret id=pipconfig,src=/path/to/some/pip.conf -t myapp --progress=plain . 
docker run --rm -it -p 5000:5000 myapp
```

### Color commentary

#### Dockerfile

* It has to start with `# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.0-experimental` to light up the ability to use the new syntax
* We reference a secret by `id`, in this case `pipconfig`. This should match the `id` you pass in during `docker build`
* We also set a destination to control where the mount lands. Otherwise it lands under `/run/secrets/{id}`

#### `docker build`

* BuildKit changes the output, so it can be hard to see what's going on. `--progress=plain` gives a more familiar "Oh look, pip is installing packages" experience

### [_CONTAINER/Dom-vs-Bom/DOM-VS-BOM.md](_CONTAINER/Dom-vs-Bom/DOM-VS-BOM.md)
## DOM vs BOM
    - the `Document Object Model` is the hierarchy/representation of the objects that comprise a document on the web (i.e. how all elements in a document are organized). The DOM is a part of the `Browser Object Model`, the hierarchy/representation of all browser objects associated with the web browser. 

**Browser Diagram**
                            User Interface
                                   v
                            Browser Engine   --->   Data Persistence
                                   v
                            Rendering Engine
                        v          v          v
                Networking  JS interpreter  UI backend
                ======================================
    - `User Interface`: everything in browser interface except requested page content
    - `Browser Engine`: manages interactions btwen UI and rendering engine
    - `Rendering Engine`: renders requested page content, parsing HTML & CSS
    - `Networking`: handles network calls, i.e. HTTP requests
    - `JS Interpreter`: parses & executes JS code
    - `UI Backend`: used for drawing basic widgets, using operating system UI methods
    - `Data Persistence`: persistence of data stored in browser, i.e. cookies

    - A browser's main role in the request/response cycle is:
        1. Parsing HTML, CSS, JS
        2. Rendering that information to the user by constructing a DOM tree and rendering it. 

**Request-Response Diagram**

    Click --->          Request --->        Server <----> Data
        Browser
    Page <---           <--- Response      

    Your Computer       The Internet        Data Center

**Window API**
-   the `Window API` includes the methods and properties that you can use on the `window object`, the core of the `BOM`. 
-   using the `Window API` to resize the browser window:
    
    ```js
    //opens a new window
    newWindow = window.open("url", "name", "width=100, height=100")
    //resizes new window
    newWindow.resizeTo(500,500)
    //also resizes by given amount; use `-` to shrink
    newWindow.resizeBy(xDelta, yDelta)
    ```

-   the `context` of an `anonymous function` fun in the browser will be the `window object`. Remember that every function has a context, which we can think of as which object OWNS the function, and context is most often determined by how a function is invoked. 

**Running Scripts**
- Insert a script via a .js document into an .html document:
    ```html
    <html>
    <head>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="dom-ready-script.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body><form>
 <input type="button" value="Go back!" onclick="history.back()">
</form>
  </body>
    <html></html>
    </html>
    ```
- Run the script on DOMContentLoaded (when the doc has been loaded, but without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes):
    ```js
    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
        console.log("This script loaded when the DOM was ready.");
    });
    ```
- Run the script on page load using window.onload (wait for EVERYTHING to load):
    ```js
    window.onload = () => {
        console.log(
            "This script loaded when all the resources and the DOM were ready."
        );
    };
    ```
- Three ways to prevent script from running until page loads:
    1. Use `DOMContentLoaded`
    2. Place `script tag` at very bottom of HTML file
    3. Add attribute like `async` or `defer`

**async vs defer**
    - `<script>` without any attributes will pause HTML parsing, and a request will be made to fetch the file (if it is external). The script will be executed before parsing is resumed. 
    - `async` downloads the file during HTML parsing and will pause the HTML parser to execute it once it has downloaded. 
    - `defer` downloads the file during HTML parsing, but will only execute it after the parser has completed. 
    - the standard is to use `async`, then `defer`. 

**Cookies vs Web Storage API**
- Cookies - stores stateful info about a user, transfers data to server, under 4KB storage limit
- `sessionStorage` - stores data only for a session, until browser window/tab is closed, does not transfer data to server, 5MB storage limit.
- `localStorage` - stores data w/no expiration date, does not transfer data to server, deleted when browser cache is cleared; maximum storage limit

- Create a cookie:
    ```js
    const firstCookie = "favoriteCat=million";
    document.cookie = firstCookie;
    const secondCookie = "favoriteDog=bambi";
    document.cookie = secondCookie;
    document.cookie; // Returns "favoriteCat=million; favoriteDog=bambi"
    ```
- Delete a cookie by setting a cookie's expiration date to the past (or delete in Developer Tools):
    ```js
    document.cookie = "favoriteCat=; expires = Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";
      document.cookie; // Returns "favoriteDog=bambi"
    ```
- Create localStorage data:
    ```js
    //set new localStorage item
    localStorage.setItem("firstThing", "firstValue");
    //retrieve that localStorage item
    localSTorage.getItem("firstThing");
    ```

- When to use the Web Storage API?
    - shopping cart
    - input data on forms
    - info on user i.e. preferences or buying habits
- When to use cookies:
    - Session cookie, stores session info on user login/validation (lost once browser is closed unless you use a persistent cookie)

- You can view cookies and web storage info with Developer Tools (inspect -> Application tab).

1. ✓ Explain the difference between BOM (browser object model) and the DOM (document object model).
2. ✓ Given a diagram of all the different parts of the Browser, identify each part.
3. ✓ Use the Window API to change the innerHeight of a user's window. 
4. ✓ Identify the context of an anonymous function running in the Browser (the window).
5. ✓ Given a JS file and an HTML file, use a script tag to import the JS file and execute the code therin when all elements on a page load (using DOMContentLoaded). 
6. ✓ Given a JS file and an HTML file, use a script tag to import the JS file and execute the code therein when the page loads. 
7. ✓ Identify three ways to prevent JS code from executing until an entire HTML page is loaded. 
8. ✓ Label a diagram on the Request/Response cycle. 
9. ✓ Explain the Browser's main role in the request/response cycle (1. Parsing HTML, CSS, JS; 2. Rendering that information to the user by constructing a DOM tree and rendering it.)
10. ✓ Given several detractors - identify which real-world situations could be implemented with the Web Storage API (shopping cart, forms savings inputs, etc.).
11. ✓ Given a website to visit that depends on cookies (like Amazon), students should be able to go to that site, add something to their cart, and then delete that cooking using Chrome Developer tools in order to empty their cart.
12. ✓ Write JS to store the value "I <3 falafel" with the eky "eatz" in the browser's local storage.
13. ✓ Write JS to read the value stored in local storage for the key "paper-trail". 

*ELEMENT SELECTION*
1. Given HTML that includes `<div id="catch-me-if-you-can>HI!</div>`, write a JS statement that stores a reference to the HTMLDivElement with the id "catch-me-if-you-can" in a variable named "divOfInterest".

    ```js
    let divOfInterest = document.getElementById("catch-me-if-you-can");
    ```

2. Given HTML that includes seven SPAN elements each with the class "cloudy", write a JS statement that stores a reference to a NodeList filled with references to the seven HTMLSpanElements in a variable named "cloud

    ```js
    let cloudyNodes = document.querySelectorAll("span.cloudy");
    ```

3. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, and BODY elements, create and reference a JS file that in which the JS will create and attach to the BODY element an H1 element with the id "sleeping-giant" with the content "Jell-O, Burled!".

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="location.file"></script>
    ```
    ```js
    let newHeader = document.createElement("h1");
    newHeader.setAttribute("id", "sleeping-giant");
    newHeader.innerHTML = "Jell-O, Burled!";
    //const newContent = document.createTextNode("Jell-O, Burled!");
    document.body.appendChild(newHeader);
    ```

4. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with the SCRIPT's SRC attribute referencing an empty JS file, write a script in the JS file to create a DIV element with the id "lickable-frog" and add it as the last child to the BODY element.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="location.file"></script>
    ```
    ```js
    let newDiv = document.createElement("div");
    newDiv.setAttribute("id", "lickable-frog");
    document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
    ```


5. Given an HTML file with HTML, HEAD, TITLE, SCRIPT, and BODY elements with no SRC attribute on the SCRIPT element, write a script in the SCRIPT block to create a UL element with no id, create an LI element with the id "dreamy-eyes, add the LI as a child to the UL element, and add the UL element as the first child of the BODY element. 

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript">
        let newList = document.createElement("ul");
        let newItem = document.createElement("li");
        newItem.setAttribute("id", "dreamy-eyes");
        newList.appendChild(newItem);
        document.body.prepend(newList);
    </script>
    ```

6. Write JS to add the CSS class "i-got-loaded" to the BODY element when the window fires the DOMContentLoaded event. 

    ```js
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
       document.body.className("i-got-loaded");
    });
    ```

7. Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-best-friend" that has six non-empty ILs as its children, write JS to write the content of each LI to the console. 

    ```js
    let parentList = document.getElementById("your-best-friend");
    let childNodes = parent.childNodes;
    for (let value of childNodes.values()) {
        console.log(value);
    }
    ```

8. Given an HTML file with a UL element with the id "your-worst-enemy" that has no children, write JS to construct a string that contains six LI tags each containing a random number and set the inner HTML property of ul#your-worst-enemy to that string. 

    ```js
    const getRandomInt = max => {
        return Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.floor(max));
    }
    const liArr = [];
    for (let i = 0, i < 6, i++) {
        liArr.push("<li>" + getRandomInt(10) + "</li>")
    }
    const liString = liArr.join(" ");
    const listElement = document.getElementById("your-worst-enemy")
    listElement.innerHTML = liString;
    ```

9. Write JS to update the title of the document to the current time at a reasonable interval such that it looks like a real clock. 
    ```html
    <title id="title"></title>
    ```
    ```js
    const title = document.getElementById("title");
    const time = () => {
        const date = new Date();
        const seconds = date.getSeconds();
        const minutes = date.getMinutes();
        const hours = date.getHours();

        title.innerHTML = `${hours}:${minutes}:${seconds}`
    };
    setInterval(time, 1000);
    ```

*EVENT HANDLING*
1. Given an HTML page that includes `<button id="increment-count">I have been clicked <span id="clicked-count">0</span> times</button>`, write JS that increases the value of the content of `span#clicked-count` by 1 every time `button#increment-count` is clicked. 

    ```js
    let incrementButton = document.getElementById("increment-count");
    let incrementSpan = document.getElementById("clicked-count");
    let count = 0
    incrementButton.addEventListener("click", event => {
        count++
        incrementSpan.innerHTML = count
    });
    ```
2. Given an HTML page that includes `<input type="checkbox" id="on-off"><div id="now-you-see-me">Now you see me</div>`, write JS that sets the display of div#now-you-see-me to "none" when input#on-off is checked and "block" when input#on-off is not checked. 

    ```js
    let inputBox = document.getElementById("checkbox");
    let divSee = document.getElementById("now-you-see-me");
    inputBox.addEventListener("click", event => {
        if (inputBox.checked) {
            divSee.style.display = "block";
        } else {
            divSee.style.display = "none";
        };
    });
    ```

3. Given an HTML file that includes `<input id="stopper" type="text" placeholder="Quick! Type STOP">`, write JS that will change the background color of the page to cyan five seconds after a page loads unless the field input#stopper contains only the text "STOP". 

    ```js
    let inputStopper = document.getElementById("stopper");
    const stopCyanMadness = () => {
        if (inputStopper.value !== "STOP") {
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = "cyan";
        }
    };
    setTimeout(stopCyanMadness, 5000);
    ```
4. Given an HTML page that includes `<input type="text" id="fancypants">`, write JS that changes the background color of the textbox to #E8F5E9 when the caret is in the textbox and turns it back to its normal color when focus is elsewhere. 

    ```js
    const input = document.getElementById("fancypands");
    input.addEventListener("focus", event => {
        event.target.style.backgroundColor = "#E8F5E9";
    });
    input.addEventListener("blur", event => {
        event.target.style.backgroundColor = "initial";
    })
    ```

5. Given an HTML page that includes a form with two password fields, write JS that subscribes to the forms submission event and cancels it if the values in the two password fields differ. 

    ```js
    let form = document.getElementById("signup-form");
    let passwordOne = document.getElementById("password);
    let passwordTwo = document.getElementById("password);
    form.addEventListener("submit", event => {
        if (passwordOne.value !== passwordTwo.value) {
            event.preventDefault();
            alert("Passwords must match!");
        } else {
            alert("The form was submitted!");
        }
    })
    ```

6. Given an HTML page that includes a div styled as a square with a red background, write JS that allows a user to draf the square around the screen. 

    1. Mark the element as draggable:
        ```html
        <div id="red-square" draggable="true"></div>
        ```

7. Given HTML page that has 300 DIVs, create one click event subscription that will print the id of the element clicked on to the console.

    ```js
    document.body.addEventListener("click", event => {
        console.log(event.target.id);
    })
    ```

8. Identify the definition of the bubbling principle. 

    When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

*JSON*
1. Identify and generate valid JSON-formatted strings.

    String in JS:   `'this is "text"'`
    String in JSON: `"this is \"text\""`

    - use \n for line breaks
    - keys in JSON objects must be surrounded by \" quotes


2. Use `JSON.parse` to deserialize JSON-formatted strings.

    ```js
    const str = '[1,"hello, \\"world\\"",3.14,{"id":17}]';
    console.log(JSON.parse(str));
        // prints an array with the following entries:
        //   0: 1
        //   1: "hello, \"world\""
        //   2: 3.14
        //   3: { id: 17 }
    ```

3. Use `JSON.stringify` to serialize JS objects. 

    ```js
    const array = [1, 'hello, "world"', 3.14, { id: 17 }];
    console.log(JSON.stringify(array));
        // prints [1, "hello, \"world\"", 3.14, {"id":17}]
    ```

4. Correctly identify the definition of "serialize". 

    Converting your data into a format that can be sent to another computer. 

5. Correctly idenfity the definition of "deserialize". 

    Getting a message from another computer and converting that message into usable data.

# 9 fancy title design in CSS you need to learn now

> Learn how to EASILY create fancy looking title with only CSS

**Style 1: Line text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*qh8otFfZQQ60V2LepbfP8A.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4416/1*qh8otFfZQQ60V2LepbfP8A.png)

The first style we would create is an outlined text, with a 3d text shape behind it. In order to create an "outline" for text, we would need to use the CSS property: `-webkit-text-stroke-width` and `-webkit-text-stroke-color` . These two property allow us to create an outline and give it the desired color.

For the 3d text shape, we could use multiple layer of `text-shadow` property. Since text-shadow can be stacked, in this example, we could add many layers of pink shadow, where each layer offsetting the previous one for 1px in x and y direction. Giving the whole text-shadow a "3D" shape.

Let jump into the code.

HTML (as promise, one div):

<div class='line-text'>foreign terrace</div>

SCSS:

> I create some global variable to store the color and the size, $extra-large is 110px. For the color, check my codepen

This is a fairly easy style, we don't even need to use a before or after pseudo-element. This is a good place to start as it teaches us two very important property in styling text, `text-stroke-width` and `text-shadow`. Say you want a more "3d-looking" text, you could easily add more layer of shadow to it, like so:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2996/1*19aEylsHnaRZBCrndxW4eA.png)

Applying 20px of box shadow

**Style 2: Neon text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2-6Srs31u8h6ZEBQ8VWr6A.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/5368/1*2-6Srs31u8h6ZEBQ8VWr6A.png)

The next style we will create is neon. The text mimic a neon sign by creating lighting effect, also using a more "written" font style.

The first thing to do is to pick a suitable font for the neon text. I picked "Pacifico" (free font on google font) as it has a nice rounded border, and continuous stroke style. Pretty much like the sign made from a neon tube.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*sSysOkBk0DJJvdNSZcgxqQ.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1744/1*sSysOkBk0DJJvdNSZcgxqQ.png)

I believe you have guessed, we would apply `-webkit-text-stroke-width` and `-webkit-text-stroke-color` again as our base for the "neon", `text-shadow` would be used again for the "glowing" light around the neon. If you look carefully, there are one more set of "outlined-text", in black color behind the neon. That is the drop shadow of the neon-tube. And we would use a :after pseudo-element to create it.

HTML:

<div class='neon-text'>underlying wire</div>

SCSS:

> one thing annoying is we need to set content of the pseudo-element manually. I tried to use `content: inherit` but it seems only possible when you set the content in your parent. As I want the HTML to have the text (for demo purpose), it is not really helpful for me.

I am not doing animation this time, but if you want, you could probably do some cool trick like turning the light on and off, changing it color gradiently and so on.

**Style 3: Stripe text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*knpwC9n4XLr-z9GG0K73Rw.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4160/1*knpwC9n4XLr-z9GG0K73Rw.png)

This style has a lot of thing in common with the first style. Firstly, it also has a white border. And secondly, it has a 3d shaped text shadow. We already know how to use `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` and`text-shadow` to create such pattern. One thing different is the colorful stripe pattern of the text.

There are no "linear-gradient" available for text (as of June 2020, let me know if it is a thing now!), so we would need a workaround. Instead of making the text itself having color, we will first create a background, and then use the `background-clip: text` property. This property will "clip" the div by the shape of your text, with a combination of making your text-color transparent, you will end up with text colored with whatever background you are using.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*UnQUNxtvHOel4W4hTz8n9w.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2060/1*UnQUNxtvHOel4W4hTz8n9w.png)

Same thing could be apply to image background, so you could basically give your text whatever texture

We would also use another font family to complement the overall style. The one I picked is "Catamaran" (also free on google font).

HTML:

<div class='stripe-text'>quick turnover</div>

SCSS:

> You may notice I put the background and `background-clip: text` in the :after element, instead of the parent. The reason for that is **"background-clip" clip EVERYTHING inside the element**, include :before and :after element. So applying it there **would cause the 3d shadow being clipped as well**. In fact, the HTML don't need to have the text at all. I am just adding it there for better sizing (as both after and before element are absolute positioned to parent) and demo purpose.

**Style 4: Cut text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*byXm5gNu5VXKWdZ9sjZE_Q.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/3216/1*byXm5gNu5VXKWdZ9sjZE_Q.png)

In all of the style, this one is actually my favourite. It is very different from the other style and our old friend `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` and`text-shadow` won't be helping us this time (sorry about that).

In this style, we have a "cut" in the text, making the upper part of text sliding down in the cut angle. The whole design is also very clean and sharp.

The concept for creating this style is very simply, we make two pseudo element (before and after), and give them two `clip-path`, where the two clip path together form a complete rectangle:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*PA8pm52sLxNIeKyEI9zWuA.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/2840/1*PA8pm52sLxNIeKyEI9zWuA.png)

And then we just add a little bit offset for the upper part element to the right and downward, making the text slide down in the "cut" direction.

HTML:

<div class='cut-text'>stolen hour</div>

SCSS:

> For the same reason mentioned in last style, we cannot clip path on the parent directly. and you may also notice in the clip-path, I used 110% instead of 100%. The reason being that the text getting clipped at the very end due to using "italic" style. it is solved by changing the clip border from 100% to a higher number.

**Style 5: Cyber text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YObcSEoVzWZ_KaHG4_S3lg.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4148/1*YObcSEoVzWZ_KaHG4_S3lg.png)

Despite the fancy name, this style is the easiest. We will be using :before and :after pseudo-element, and transparent text-color overlaying on top of each other to create this "funky" effect. The text look kind of blur but actually it is completely straight if you look closely, it is the mixture of the color and minor offset giving it such behavior.

HTML:

<div class='cyber-text'>digital highway</div>

SCSS:

> The SCSS function rgba() allow us to quickly get a less opaque version of your base color, and make experimenting of different color combination easy. (There are also darken()/lighten()/adjust-hue() and soooo much more)

**Style 6: Wood-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lDBHarduK4EUC41wHNdcvQ.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/3900/1*lDBHarduK4EUC41wHNdcvQ.png)

This one is basically the same as the "stripe-text" style, as we are again using `background-clip: text` property. As mentioned, with background-clip property you could easily create any pattern and texture of text, given that you have a background image.

One little twist of this style is the inner "shadow" of the text. It is in fact created with an after element with (again) `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` property.

HTML:

<div class='wood-text'>suitable villa</div>

SCSS:

> Looking back to it now, this one is my least favourite one. Mainly due to the background image I picked doesn't really resemble wood. (in fact the highlight and shading of it make it looks more like metallic) For this type of text style, background image is the soul of it, and could ruin it pretty easily. Don't make the same mistake I did and take your time to pick the perfect picture.

**Style 7: Comic-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-PluYzXMrwt09anUuBne6Q.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/3824/1*-PluYzXMrwt09anUuBne6Q.png)

This comic looking style text resemble old fashion comic text. Everything is heavily outlined, and the stroke are overly decorated. To start with, we will first need a font for this style. I picked "Molle", again (guess you figure out the pattern by now) a free google font.

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Q2vMDKRQTPIXfs1EKcTGAQ.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/1832/1*Q2vMDKRQTPIXfs1EKcTGAQ.png)

For the style itself, we will use our old friend `-webkit-text-stroke-width` ,`-webkit-text-stroke-color` property (welcome back!).We would use all of our available HTML element for the style, the parent div, before, and after pseudo element.

HTML:

<div class='comic-text'>square tube!</div>

SCSS:

> I am limiting myself to do it in one div only, but you can definitely adding more layer if you want to, just stack the element on top of eachother

**Style 8: horizontal-cut-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*_ZOGCf8dCQAFXHk7pMM42A.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4712/1*_ZOGCf8dCQAFXHk7pMM42A.png)

This style also has the word cut in it, but we won't actually cut it. Instead, we will use a background gradient and `background-clip: text` property again. We will stack two background, one with color at the top 50%, transparent at the bottom 50%, and another background a white and transparent stripe.

On top of the text, we would also add a text-shadow, to give more shape to it. Using a shadow on top of the text with dark background, resulting it having a fake "highlight", which is the original color of the text.

HTML:

<div class='horizontal-cut-text'>vague minority</div>

SCSS:

> Again, another one without any after and before element. In case you don't know already, you can stack background color as much as you want to. Using background property alone could already give us a lot of stunning pattern.

**Style 9: Double-border-text**

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*bnZB7hU-3oN6O6R2vnTlgw.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/4540/1*bnZB7hU-3oN6O6R2vnTlgw.png)

The final style, you guessed it, is a combination of `-webkit-text-stroke-width` and pseudo-element. This is basically the same as the comic style, just with a different font, more consistent and aligned text and color theme.

Since it is very similar, I will jump into the code right now.

HTML:

<div class='double-border-text'>entire volume</div>

SCSS:

> One side note regarding `text-stroke-width`, it seems all powerful but has it own limitation. If the font you are using don't have a beautiful and continuous stroke, your will get a "broken" stroke from the property. Also, be aware that if you set the stroke width too high, there may be unexpected "edge" from the stroke of the text, like below:

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/52/1*8D039RUBG9sKBsWt7wA6tw.png?q=20)

![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/724/1*8D039RUBG9sKBsWt7wA6tw.png)

the edge is coming from the middle stroke of the "E"

### [_CONTAINER/graph-notes/graph-representation.md](_CONTAINER/graph-notes/graph-representation.md)


## Ways to Reference Graph Nodes

---

### Node Class

---

Uses a class to define the neighbors as properties of each node.

```js
class GraphNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.neighbors = [];
  }
}

let a = new GraphNode("a");
let b = new GraphNode("b");
let c = new GraphNode("c");
let d = new GraphNode("d");
let e = new GraphNode("e");
let f = new GraphNode("f");
a.neighbors = [e, c, b];
c.neighbors = [b, d];
e.neighbors = [a];
f.neighbors = [e];
```

---

### Adjacency Matrix

---

The row index will corespond to the source of an edge and the column index will correspond to the edges destination.

- When the edges have a direction, `matrix[i][j]` may not be the same as `matrix[j][i]`
- It is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself so `matrix[x][x]` is true for any node
- Will be O(n^2) space complexity

let matrix = [

|       | **A**   | **B**  | **C**  | **D**  | **E**  | **F**  |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **A** | [True,  | True,  | True,  | False, | True,  | False] |
| **B** | [False, | True,  | False, | False, | False, | False] |
| **C** | [False, | True,  | True,  | True,  | False, | False] |
| **D** | [False, | False, | False, | True,  | False, | False] |
| **E** | [True,  | False, | False, | False, | True,  | False] |
| **F** | [False, | False, | False, | False, | True,  | True]  |

];

---

### Adjacency List

---

Seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation. It uses an object where keys represent node labels and values associated with that key are the adjacent node keys held in an array.

```js
let graph = {
  a: ["b", "c", "e"],
  b: [],
  c: ["b", "d"],
  d: [],
  e: ["a"],
  f: ["e"],
};
```

---

---

## Code Examples

---

### Basic Graph Class

```js
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjList = {};
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjList[vertex]) this.adjList[vertex] = [];
  }

  addEdges(srcValue, destValue) {
    this.addVertex(srcValue);
    this.addVertex(destValue);
    this.adjList[srcValue].push(destValue);
    this.adjList[destValue].push(srcValue);
  }

  buildGraph(edges) {
    edges.forEach((ele) => {
      this.addEdges(ele[0], ele[1]);
    });
    return this.adjList;
  }

  breadthFirstTraversal(startingVertex) {
    const queue = [startingVertex];
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = new Array();

    while (queue.length) {
      const value = queue.shift();
      if (visited.has(value)) continue;
      result.push(value);
      visited.add(value);
      queue.push(...this.adjList[value]);
    }
    return result;
  }

  depthFirstTraversalIterative(startingVertex) {
    const stack = [startingVertex];
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = new Array();

    while (stack.length) {
      const value = stack.pop();
      if (visited.has(value)) continue;
      result.push(value);
      visited.add(value);
      stack.push(...this.adjList[value]);
    }
    return result;
  }

  depthFirstTraversalRecursive(
    startingVertex,
    visited = new Set(),
    vertices = []
  ) {
    if (visited.has(startingVertex)) return [];

    vertices.push(startingVertex);
    visited.add(startingVertex);

    this.adjList[startingVertex].forEach((vertex) => {
      this.depthFirstTraversalRecursive(vertex, visited, vertices);
    });
    return [...vertices];
  }
```

---

### Node Class Examples

```js
class GraphNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.neighbors = [];
  }
}

function breadthFirstSearch(startingNode, targetVal) {
  const queue = [startingNode];
  const visited = new Set();

  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;
    visited.add(node.val);

### Traversal Examples

#### With Graph Node Class

```js
function depthFirstRecur(node, visited = new Set()) {
  if (visited.has(node.val)) return;

  console.log(node.val);
  visited.add(node.val);

  node.neighbors.forEach((neighbor) => {
    depthFirstRecur(neighbor, visited);
  });
}

function depthFirstIter(node) {
  let visited = new Set();
  let stack = [node];

  while (stack.length) {
    let node = stack.pop();

    if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;

    console.log(node.val);
    visited.add(node.val);

    stack.push(...node.neighbors);
  }
}
```

### With Adjacency List

```js
function depthFirst(graph) {
  let visited = new Set();

  for (let node in graph) {
    _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited);
  }
}

function _depthFirstRecur(node, graph, visited) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;

  console.log(node);
  visited.add(node);

  graph[node].forEach((neighbor) => {
    _depthFirstRecur(neighbor, graph, visited);
  });
}
```

## Ways to Reference Graph Nodes

---

### Node Class

---

Uses a class to define the neighbors as properties of each node.

```js
class GraphNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.neighbors = [];
  }
}

let a = new GraphNode("a");
let b = new GraphNode("b");
let c = new GraphNode("c");
let d = new GraphNode("d");
let e = new GraphNode("e");
let f = new GraphNode("f");
a.neighbors = [e, c, b];
c.neighbors = [b, d];
e.neighbors = [a];
f.neighbors = [e];
```

---

### Adjacency Matrix

---

The row index will corespond to the source of an edge and the column index will correspond to the edges destination.

- When the edges have a direction, `matrix[i][j]` may not be the same as `matrix[j][i]`
- It is common to say that a node is adjacent to itself so `matrix[x][x]` is true for any node
- Will be O(n^2) space complexity

let matrix = [

|       | **A**   | **B**  | **C**  | **D**  | **E**  | **F**  |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| **A** | [True,  | True,  | True,  | False, | True,  | False] |
| **B** | [False, | True,  | False, | False, | False, | False] |
| **C** | [False, | True,  | True,  | True,  | False, | False] |
| **D** | [False, | False, | False, | True,  | False, | False] |
| **E** | [True,  | False, | False, | False, | True,  | False] |
| **F** | [False, | False, | False, | False, | True,  | True]  |

];

---

### Adjacency List

---

Seeks to solve the shortcomings of the matrix implementation. It uses an object where keys represent node labels and values associated with that key are the adjacent node keys held in an array.

```js
let graph = {
  a: ["b", "c", "e"],
  b: [],
  c: ["b", "d"],
  d: [],
  e: ["a"],
  f: ["e"],
};
```

---

---

## Code Examples

---

### Basic Graph Class

```js
class Graph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjList = {};
  }

  addVertex(vertex) {
    if (!this.adjList[vertex]) this.adjList[vertex] = [];
  }

  addEdges(srcValue, destValue) {
    this.addVertex(srcValue);
    this.addVertex(destValue);
    this.adjList[srcValue].push(destValue);
    this.adjList[destValue].push(srcValue);
  }

  buildGraph(edges) {
    edges.forEach((ele) => {
      this.addEdges(ele[0], ele[1]);
    });
    return this.adjList;
  }

  breadthFirstTraversal(startingVertex) {
    const queue = [startingVertex];
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = new Array();

    while (queue.length) {
      const value = queue.shift();
      if (visited.has(value)) continue;
      result.push(value);
      visited.add(value);
      queue.push(...this.adjList[value]);
    }
    return result;
  }

  depthFirstTraversalIterative(startingVertex) {
    const stack = [startingVertex];
    const visited = new Set();
    const result = new Array();

    while (stack.length) {
      const value = stack.pop();
      if (visited.has(value)) continue;
      result.push(value);
      visited.add(value);
      stack.push(...this.adjList[value]);
    }
    return result;
  }

  depthFirstTraversalRecursive(
    startingVertex,
    visited = new Set(),
    vertices = []
  ) {
    if (visited.has(startingVertex)) return [];

    vertices.push(startingVertex);
    visited.add(startingVertex);

    this.adjList[startingVertex].forEach((vertex) => {
      this.depthFirstTraversalRecursive(vertex, visited, vertices);
    });
    return [...vertices];
  }
```

### Node Class Examples

```js
class GraphNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.neighbors = [];
  }
}

function breadthFirstSearch(startingNode, targetVal) {
  const queue = [startingNode];
  const visited = new Set();

  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    if (visited.has(node.val)) continue;
    visited.add(node.val);
    if (node.val === targetVal) return node;
    node.neighbors.forEach((ele) => queue.push(ele));
  }
  return null;
}

function numRegions(graph) {
  let maxLength = 0;
  for (node in graph) {
    if (graph[node].length > maxLength) maxLength = graph[node].length;
  }
  if (maxLength === 0) {
    return (length = Object.keys(graph).length);
  } else {
    return maxLength;
  }
}

function maxValue(node, visited = new Set()) {
  let queue = [node];
  let maxValue = 0;
  while (queue.length) {
    let currentNode = queue.shift();
    if (visited.has(currentNode.val)) continue;
    visited.add(currentNode.val);
    if (currentNode.val > maxValue) maxValue = currentNode.val;
    currentNode.neighbors.forEach((ele) => queue.push(ele));
  }
  return maxValue;

Getting Started
---------------

To get started using the action, just make sure to have a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#define-a-procfile) or a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) in your project and then create a folder called **.github** and inside it, create another folder called **workflows**. Finally inside the workflows folder, create a file called **main.yml** with the following contents:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"

Now go to your Heroku account and go to Account Settings. Scroll to the bottom until you see API Key. Copy this key and go to your project's repository on GitHub.

In your Repo, go to Settings -> Secrets and click on "New Secret". Then enter HEROKU\_API\_KEY as the name and paste the copied API Key as the value.

You can now push your project to GitHub and it will be automatically deployed to Heroku henceforth.

You learn more about GitHub Secrets [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) and GitHub Actions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Important Note
--------------

**Please Note**: Git has recently announced that it is planning to switch the default branch's name from "**master**" to "**main**". For this reason, the Action also pushes to the "**main**" branch in the heroku origin by default and if your Heroku App is still using the "**master**" branch, then the Action will automatically switch your Heroku remote to use "**main**" as the default branch. There is **No Action Needed** from you, just keep in mind that this change is occurring as you continue to use the App and if you ever need to manually deploy the App, you can do so using the following command:

git push heroku YOUR\_BRANCH:refs/heads/main

Also the `remote_branch` property no longer exists in the latest release of the Action. If you still have this as part of the `3.10.9` release. Please remove it as it may cause problems in your workflow

Options
-------

The action comes with additional options that you can use to configure your project's behavior on Heroku. You can setup these options under the "with" object as presented above:

| Name                          | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                        |

Examples
--------

### Deploy with Docker

Heroku now allows users to deploy docker containers. To use this feature, simply add a Dockerfile to your project and add a `CMD` command at the end of the Dockerfile. This is the command used by heroku to start the webserver inside the container. Finally make sure to set the `usedocker` flag to true before deploying.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          usedocker: true

Keep in mind that if you deploy once using docker, the same heroku app is not compatible with a non-docker setup and similarly, you cannot deploy a dockerized setup to a non-docker heroku app.

If you need to pass in any ARGs for the Docker build, you may provide a list of arg names which automatically pull from the environment.

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          usedocker: true
          docker\_build\_args: |
 NODE\_ENV
 SECRET\_KEY
        env:
          NODE\_ENV: production
          SECRET\_KEY: ${{ secrets.MY\_SECRET\_KEY }}

Also, thanks to [Olav Sundfør](https://github.com/olaven) for adding the Docker feature and [Matt Stavola](https://github.com/mbStavola) for adding the ability to pass in build args.

### Deploy with custom Buildpacks

Taken from the official heroku website:

"Heroku Buildpacks are sets of open source scripts that are used for compiling apps on Heroku. They form the backbone of Heroku's [polyglot platform](https://www.heroku.com/languages). Buildpacks enable you to extend Heroku's build system to support your language or customizations, or to make particular binary packages available to the runtime. Heroku Buildpacks give you the freedom to code in the languages and frameworks that work best for your app and your team"

To use a custom buildpack in the action, simply add the url of the buildpack to the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          buildpack: "https://github.com/HashNuke/heroku-buildpack-elixir.git"

### Deploy Subdirectory

If you are using a complex application which has both frontend and backend applications in separate folders, you can specify a path to the directory to deploy using the **appdir** option:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          appdir: "api" # <- This will point to the api folder in your project

Thanks to [meszarosdezso](https://github.com/meszarosdezso) for adding the appdir feature

### Deploy custom branch

You can use the **branch** option to deploy an app in another branch

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          branch: "dev"

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

### Deploy custom remote branch

You can use the **remote\_branch** option to deploy an app to another remote branch

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          remote\_branch: "main"

Though this is also possible to do with GitHub Actions, click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information

Health Check
------------

Sometimes you will run into issues where the action has successfully deployed the project but because of some error in code or the like, the Heroku App crashes or fails to launch. To counter this, you can setup a healthcheck in the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"

Adding the url to the healthcheck option of the action will make the action attempt to perform a GET Request to that url and print the response if successful. Else it will fail the action to indicate that the deploy was not successful.

P.S: It is recommended that you setup a specific route such as **/health** for performing healthchecks

### Advanced Usage

Additionally, if you are using a custom route for performing healthchecks, you can check for a specific value from this url using the **checkstring** option of the action like so:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"
          checkstring: "ok"

This will essentially check if the value returned by sending a GET request to the **healthcheck** url is equal to the **checkstring**

### Adding Delay

In some cases, a healthcheck ends up being performed before the application has been setup on Heroku. To counter this, you can manually set the **delay** option in the action to make the action wait a certain period of time (in seconds) before performing the healthcheck

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"
          checkstring: "ok"
          delay: 5

By default, the delay will be 0 if you choose to not set it

### Rollback on healthcheck failure

You can set the rollbackonhealthcheckfailed option to ensure that your application is rolled back if the healthcheck fails. _.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          healthcheck: "https://\[YOUR APP's NAME\].herokuapp.com/health"
          checkstring: "ok"
          rollbackonhealthcheckfailed: true

By default, the application will not be rolled back if the healthcheck fails.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Heroku offers a means of passing sensitive information to your app (such as api keys etc) via something it calls **config vars** which you can find in the settings of your heroku app. But sometimes you might want to store sensitive information (api keys etc) in GitHub Secrets instead just to ensure platform independence. If you choose to this, you can then pass those secrets to your heroku app by using the "env" object of the action:-

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
        env:
          HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY: ${{secrets.FIREBASE\_API\_KEY}}
          HD\_RANDOM\_DATA: "Hello"

Note that the variables must start with "**HD\_**". This is is important so the action can tell your environment variable apart from multiple other variables (passed by your language, github actions etc) which you probably don't want sitting in your heroku app's config vars.

On that note, if you've set these variables and have deployed your app, you can check your Heroku App's config vars and you'll find that they have been set with the env variables you have passed.

**PLEASE NOTE**: The "**HD\_**" will be scrapped from the variable your name by the action. So in your project, "**FIREBASE\_API\_KEY**" will be passed instead of "**HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY**" (for example) and you can see this if you check your Heroku App's config vars. We understand that this can be confusing but this is again to ensure Platform independence and so that you don't have to use HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY if you choose to stop using Heroku

### ENV File

You can if you wish also pass the path to an env file (with respect to your appdir path) as an option to the action. The action will then read that file and set the config vars accordingly in Heroku

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          env\_file: ".env"
        env:
          HD\_FIREBASE\_API\_KEY: ${{secrets.FIREBASE\_API\_KEY}}
          HD\_RANDOM\_DATA: "Hello"

Example env file

    HELLO=world
    WORLD=hello
    

There are two important points to keep in mind when using the **env\_file** option.

1.  The first is that in can be used in conjunction with **env** option of the action as you have seen above
    
2.  The second is that unlike in the **env** option, you do not need to prefix the env variables in the .env file with "HD\_".
    
    (For those of you who are wondering why this is the case, when using the **env** option, the env variables are passed directly into the process along with all the other env variables passed by GitHub Actions, the language you are using etc and the "HD\_" in that case is to help differentiate your env variables from them. But when using a file to pass the env variables, the action manually reads the file so there is no chance of stray env variables being passed by your language, github actions etc and hence no need to add the "HD\_")
    

Also note that using a file (which can be named anything so long as it follows the format of a standard env file) can be useful if you're trying to send a very large number of env variables to Heroku, it does mean that keeping the .env file secure and private is entirely in your hands so tread with caution.

Procfile Passing
----------------

In some cases, you might want to be able to set the Procfile within the action itself instead of declaring it manually in your project. Although this approach is not recommended in favor of just using multiple branches, it might still be useful in some edge cases. You can set the Procfile in the action by using the **procfile** option of the action like so:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: "YOUR APP's NAME" #Must be unique in Heroku
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          procfile: "web: npm start"

Keep in mind this won't work if you are using Docker.

Deploying to a team
-------------------

If you are an enterprise user and wish to deploy your app to a specific team, you can do so by just passing the **team** option to the action:

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:

Just Login
----------

GitHub Actions does come with the heroku cli pre-installed (this is what is used by the Action to deploy applications). So if you wish to use the heroku cli and just need to login, you can use the **justlogin** option of the Heroku Deploy Action

_.github/workflows/main.yml_

name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master # Changing the branch here would also work

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.11.10 # This is the action
        with:
          heroku\_api\_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU\_API\_KEY}}
          heroku\_app\_name: ""
          heroku\_email: "YOUR EMAIL"
          justlogin: true
      - run: heroku auth:whoami

Important Notes
---------------

*   You can check this repo's [_.github/workflows/main.yml_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) for example use cases of the action in use. Additionally the APIs for these use cases can be found in the [_tests_](https://github.com/AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy/tree/master/tests) folder of the repo
    
*   You can find the secrets tab in your project's settings
    
*   Be careful with your appname, cuz the action either deploys to an existing app or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. So if you accidently change it after deploying it once already, the action won't fail, it'll just create a new dyno and if you are on a paid plan, heroku can be expensive. On that note, always check the logs of your actions to make sure everything is A-OK.
    
*   If you're using the above exact workflow code, keep in mind that it deploys whenever you make a change to the master branch (Even README updates which have nothing to do with application code) and that might not be very efficient for you, have a look through the github actions docs to customize when the action should trigger.
    
    (I would recommend making a separate dev branch and setting up the action to trigger upon pull request to the master branch)
    
*   By default, if you don't specify a branch in your action, it will default to the HEAD branch (or whichever branch the action is defined under). So you might be wondering what happens if you define the same action in a different branch under the same heroku app name (or which you try to deploy to the same appname from a different branch)? The answer is that the new branch overrides whatever your old branch was (even if the new branch is behind the old branch in terms of commits unless you set dontuseforce to true)
    
*   For more info on how Heroku enables deployment using Docker, check out [https://www.heroku.com/deploy-with-docker](https://www.heroku.com/deploy-with-docker)

* What is [*happens-before*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happened-before) relation?
* What is [*thread contention*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1970345/what-is-thread-contention)? (Contention is simply when two threads try to access either the same resource or related resources in such a way that at least one of the contending threads runs more slowly than it would if the other thread(s) were not running). Contention occurs when multiple threads try to acquire a lock at the same time
* What is a [*thread-safe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety) function? (Can be safely invoked by multiple threads at the same time)
* [*Publish/Subscribe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) pattern
* What is [*2-phase locking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_locking)? (Growing phase, shrinking phase. Guarantees serializablity for transactions, doesn't prevent deadlock).

* What is a
  * [*obstruction-free*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Obstruction-freedom) - if all other threads are paused, then any given thread will complete its operation in a bounded number of steps
  * [*lock-free*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Lock-freedom) - if multiple threads are operating on a data structure, then after a bounded number of steps one of them will complete its operation
  * [*wait-free*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Wait-freedom) - every thread operating on a data structure will complete its operation in a bounded number of steps, even if other threads are also operating on the data structure

  algorithm?
* What is [*sequential consistency*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_consistency)? (The result of any execution is the same as if the operations of all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program).
* What is a [*memory barrier*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier)? (A memory barrier, also known as a membar, memory fence or fence instruction, is a type of barrier instruction that causes a CPU or compiler to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction)
* Synchonization aids in Java
  * CountDownLatch
  * CyclicBarrier
  * Phaser
  * ReentrantLock
  * Exchanger
  * Semaphore
  * LinkedTransferQueue
* What is *data race*? (When a program contains two conflicting accesses that are not ordered by a [happens-before](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5) relationship, it is said to contain a data race. Two accesses to (reads of or writes to) the same variable are said to be conflicting if at least one of the accesses is a write. But see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16615140/is-volatile-read-happens-before-volatile-write/16615355#16615355))
* Java [*memory model*](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4)
  * A program is correctly synchronized if and only if all sequentially consistent executions are free of data races
  * Correctly synchronized programs have sequentially consistent semantics. If a program is correctly synchronized, then all executions of the program will appear to be sequentially consistent
  * Causality requirement for incorrectly synchronized programs: [link](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c132/11697f5c803221533a07bd6db839fa60b7b8.pdf)

It's used by most competitive programmers who use Java as their main language. Be sure to check out [CHelper](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7091-chelper), a very handy plugin written for programming contests. |
| ★★☆ | [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Sublime Text is an extraordinary text editor. Packed with powerful and innovative features like Multiple Carets, Minimaps and Command Palletes, it attracts a strong and engaging community. Sublime Text is highly extensible, so be sure to have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed and explore perhaps one of the largest catalogue of plugins! |
| ★★☆ | [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | Eclipse is another good IDE for Java. It's an okay alternative to Intellij IDEA (A tad inferior to IDEA by today's standards). Sometimes contests only provide Eclipse for some reason, so this might be a good incentive to try and use Eclipse. |
| ★★☆ | [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/) | GUI / Cross-Platform | CLion, produced by JetBrains - the same company who made Intellij IDEA, is a powerful IDE for C++. Free educational licenses are available OR you can try out their [EAP (Early Access Program)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/CLION/Early+Access+Program) which is still free as of Apr, 2018. You may want to turn off its code inspection feature as it will cause quite a bit of lag. |
| ★☆☆ | Other IDEs | Mixed | [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) is the IDE to use in case you want to code in C#. ... Both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are built with Electron (written in JavaScript) and therefore somewhat resource-hogging. ... [CodeLite](https://codelite.org/) is a newly rising IDE. Beware that the load-up and project-creation times can be extraordinary. |

</details><details> <summary>_CONTAINER/intro-2-js-markdown/</summary>

### [_CONTAINER/intro-2-js-markdown/intro-2-js.md](_CONTAINER/intro-2-js-markdown/intro-2-js.md)
## V1 - Getting started

* Arrays are lists: `['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']`.
* Variables are nicknames for data: `var todos = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3']`.
* Semicolons act sort of like periods do in English. They don't appear at the end of every line though.
* Proper semicolon usage is particularly important when you are saving to a file, so pay close attention to how I use semicolons in `todoList.html`. I'll note exceptions as we get to them.
* You can ignore my semicolon usage in the console since I treat that environment like a temporary scratchpad/whiteboard.
* Use `console.log` to display data in the console. Example: `console.log('hi hi hi!')`.
* Computers start counting from 0, not 1.
* On an array, use `.push` to add data to the end of the array. Example: `myArray.push('new data')`.
* Get an element at a certain position: `array[position]`.
* Change an element at a certain position: `array[position] = 'changed!`.
* Remove an element at a certain position: `array.splice(position, 1)`.

## Functions - Interlude

* Characteristic 1: Functions group multiple lines of code together under a single name.

```javascript
// Declaring a function.
function functionName() {
  // Body of function. You can put 0 or more 
  // lines of code between the curly braces.
}

// To run the function, add a set of parentheses to the function name.
functionName();
```

* Characteristic 2: When you a run a function, you can provide the function with data.

```javascript
// myData is a parameter. Parameters differ from variables in two ways:
// 1. Parameters are declared at the same time a function is created.
// 2. Parameters are assigned a value only when the function is run.
function demoFunction(myData) {
  console.log(myData);
}

demoFunction('gordon'); // myData = 'gordon'
demoFunction('watch and code'); // myData = 'watch and code'

// Notice that we do NOT use semicolons after the opening 
// and closing curly braces in function declarations.
```

## V2 - Using functions

* Functions can have 0, 1, or *more* parameters.

```javascript
function edit(position, newValue) {
  todos[position] = newValue;
  console.log(todos);
}
```

## The computer's perspective - Interlude

* To understand the computer's perspective, you need to understand every little thing that happens in each line of code. To do this, you must learn how to use the debugger effectively.
* When I see the "Step over" button, I think "step over to next line of code that's about to run".
* When you hit "Step over", you will not necessarily go to the next line of code in the file. You have to think about what will happen.
* The "Resume script execution" is sorta of like an unpause button. It'll exit the debugger or go to the next breakpoint (if there is one).
* Delusional thinking is not compatible with success (programming or otherwise).
* Use the expectations/reality framework (along with the debugger) to improve the quality of your thinking.
* Use "Step into" to go into any function call *except* built-in functions.
* Use the `debugger` statement to set breakpoints in the console without writing to a file. 

## Questions and quality - Interlude 

* Ask high quality questions. How you approach this will be a deciding factor in how good you will be.
* Throughout your journey learning to program (or with anything really), you will be faced with choices like this. One path leads to high ability, the other path leads to low ability. Choose wisely.

## Functions and variables - Interlude

* If you're inside of a function, you can look out and see data, but the opposite isn't true. If you're outside, you can't look in.
* Whenever you're in doubt, draw circles and arrows. Arrows can only exit circles; they can never go in.
* "Scope" is a fancy term for describing variable visibility.

## V3 - Using objects

* `true` and `false` are boolean values.
* Use objects to group related data together

```javascript
var todo = {
  todoText: 'Get groceries',
  completed: false
};

// Access properties with dot notation.
console.log(todo.todoText); // 'Get groceries'
console.log(todo.completed); // false
```

## V4 - Toggling
* Comparisons: Use `===` to see if two things are equal to each other.
* Use if statements to conditionally run chunks of code.
```javascript
if (true) {
  console.log('This line of code will run.');
}

if (false) {
  console.log('This line of code will not run.');
}

// Notice that we do NOT use semicolons after the opening 
// and closing curly braces in if statements.

```
* `if/else` statements offer another way to structure conditional logic.
```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Will run if condition is true.
} else {
  // Will run if condition is false.
} 
```

## Data types and comparisons - Interlude

* JavaScript has two broad types of data, objects and primitives.
* Objects can be as complex as you want. Examples include arrays and functions.
* Primitives are the simple building blocks of the language.
* There are five main primitives: strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null.
* Comparisons with primitives work how most people would expect (like math class).
* Comparisons with objects work very differently.
* Make sure you understand why `[1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3]` is `false`.

## V5 - Displaying data better

* Use a for-loop to repeat a piece of code any number of times.

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
  // 0
  // 1
  // 2
  // 3
  // 4
}

// Notice that we do NOT use semicolons after the opening 
// and closing curly braces in for-loops.
```

## V6 - Toggle all

* Boolean logic can be complicated. Make sure that you carefully think about different situations before you start coding. 

## V7 - Buttons!

* HTML syntax for buttons: `<button>My button</button>`.
* Vocab lesson: A function on an object is called a "method".
```javascript
var gordon = { 
  name: 'Gordon',                  // property
  city: 'San Francisco',           // property
  myMethod: function sayHi() {     // method
    console.log('Hi');
  }
};
```
* Use the `document` object to access the webpage in your JavaScript.
* Use the `document.getElementById` method to grab an element by id.
```javascript
var displayTodosButton = document.getElementById('display-todos-button');
```
* Elements have a `addEventListener` method, which can be used to respond to events.
```javascript
// The first argument is an event type.
// The second argument is a function that'll run 
// whenever the event occurs on the element.
// In this example, whenever the displayTodosButton is clicked,
// the displayTodos function will run.
displayTodosButton.addEventListener('click', displayTodos);
```

## Experimenting with functions - Interlude
* You need to get to the point where the results of these experiments are obvious and familiar to you.
```javascript
function demoFunction() {}

var experiment1 = demoFunction;   // ?
var experiment2 = demoFunction(); // ?

function demoFunctionThatReturnsAString() {
  return 'a string';
}
 
var experiment3 = demoFunctionThatReturnsAString;   // ?
var experiment4 = demoFunctionThatReturnsAString(); // ?

function demoFunctionThatReturnsUndefined() {
  return undefined;
}

var experiment5 = demoFunctionThatReturnsUndefined;   // ?
var experiment6 = demoFunctionThatReturnsUndefined(); // ?

function logThis(thing) {
  console.log(thing);
}

// Experiment 7
logThis(demoFunctionThatReturnsAString);   // ?

// Experiment 8
logThis(demoFunctionThatReturnsAString()); // ?
```

## V8 - Getting data from inputs

* In your HTML, use `<input>` to get user input.
* In your JavaScript, use `input.value` to get/set an input's value.

## V9 - Escape from the console

* In HTML, use `ul`s and `li`s for listing data.
```
<ul>
  <li>First</li>
  <li>Second</li>
  <li>Third</li>
</ul>
```
* Use `document.createElement` to create elements in JavaScript.
```javascript
var todoLi = document.createElement('li');
```
* Use the `appendChild` method to add elements to the page.
```javascript
var todosUl = document.getElementById('todos-ul');
todosUl.appendChild(todoLi);
```
* Use the `innerHTML` property to get/set an element's html.
* Use the `innerText` property to get/set an element's text.
* Use `+` to combine strings. 

## V10 - Click to delete
* Went through the pros/cons of different ways to access the remove button that was clicked. Making informed tradeoffs is one of the most important skills that you will learn.
* Functions passed to `addEventListener` are called with an event object, which describes the event that occurred.
```javascript
function remove(event) {
  // We used event.currentTarget to access the remove button element that was clicked.
  // Elements have an id property we can use to get/set the id.
  var position = event.currentTarget.id;
  todos.splice(position, 1);
  displayTodos();
}
```

## V11 - Click to toggle

* Element ids should be unique.
* Practiced thinking through the pros/cons of different ways to extract position from ids.
```javascript
// We ended up choosing this technique.
var idString = 'todo-0';
var position = idString.split('-')[1];
```

## V12 - Click to edit

* `prompt()` is a simple way to get user input.
* Use `!==` to test for inequality.
* Use `&&` to combine comparisons.

# Introduction to Ruby
## Why Learn Ruby?
* It has learned/stolen a ton from the languages that came before it. 
* It's elegant and easy to learn
* It doesn't focus on making code as short as possible, it cares about readability
* It has a huge community behind it - documentation, tutorials, etc.
* RAILS!
Ruby is a well designed object oriented language.  It is easy to read and stresses the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.  Since many of the method names and the ruby syntax itself is so much like english, it is an ideal language to start with.

## Objectives
 * Ruby docs
 * Variables and assignments
  - Strings
  - Symbols
  - Fixnum, Float
 * Input and Output
 * Arrays
 * Booleans

## My First Ruby App - basic Hello World
* Everyone let's make a new folder for our ruby exercises:
	* ``mkdir ruby_exercises ``
* Make a new ruby file
	* ``subl ex1.rb``
* Add this to the file: 
	* ``puts 'hello world'``
	* ``puts 'my name is Bryan'``
* Now let's run our code.  Execute it with:
	* ``ruby ex1.rb``
* Ok great, our first program!  Let's add a comment and then run our code:
	* 	``#this code won't run!``
* Now let's do something different
	* ``puts '2 + 2'``
* Oh now!  That's not what we want.  How can we get it to evaluate the expression?
	* ``puts 2+ 2``
* So what's the difference?  When we use quotes, we are making a **string**.  It's text and isn't evaluated.

##Let's talk about numbers and math!
So let's do some more math besides just ``2 + 2``

* To play around with some math expressions, we're going to use something called **IRB**.  It allows us to execute short bits of Ruby code without saving it to a file and running it in the terminal.
* In IRB we can evaluate simple expressions:

```
puts "This is IRB!"
5
1000009 
```

So we have numbers!  We can do some operations with those numbers:

```
2+2
46-100
10*20
81/9
1/3 # notice what happens when we run this.
```

* We run into a problem!  That shouldn't be 0.  So what's going on?
* **Integers **are numbers without decimal points
* **Floating-Point Numbers** (floats) are numbers with decimal points

These expressions follow the order of operations.  So we can do something like:
``10 * (25 - 1)``

## EXERCISE TIME!
Write a program that outputs the number of minutes in a decade
``puts 60 * 24 * (365 * 10 + 2)``

## So let's go back to Strings
* Strings are basically groups of letters.  Things like:
	* `Ruby is awesome`
* As you've seen already we use `puts` to print things
* String Arithmetic.  
	*	You can sort of add 2 strings
		* `puts 'I like' + 'ice cream'`
	* We can also multiply them
		* puts "Hello World" * 100
	* Make sure we know the difference between numbers and digits:
	
		```
		puts 2 * 5
		puts '2' * 5
		puts '2 * 5'
		```
		
What if we want to print out the string "You're awesome"

``puts 'You\'re awesome'``

Ok, so what if we want to type the '\\' character like in 'Up\Down'

```
puts "up\\down"
puts "This should go on a \n new line"
```


## Booleans
Booleans can only have 2 values.  TRUE or FALSE

```
100 > 1
60 < 20
```
## VARIABLES
So far, we've learned about data types, but we can't do anything with these values. Variables allow us to store values and use them later.  Here's a really simple example.

```
puts 'you can say that again'
puts 'you can say that again'
# We can use a variable to help us out here
#Variables have 2 parts - NAME and VALUE
my_string = 'you can say that again'
puts my_string
puts my_string
```
So we're storing a value in the computer's memory for later use.  You can think of it as  my_string is pointing to 'you can say that again'

Of course variables can point to any data type.  So let's try another example:

```
score_1 = 99.5
score_2 = 80
average = (score_1 + score_2)/2
**#what happens if we do this:**

puts  "The average test score is: " + average

It doens't work, so we need string interpolation!
puts "The average test score is #{average}"
```
**String Interpolation**

When naming variables, most Ruby programmers use **snake_case**

### Code Along
We are going to make a simple app that asks for your first name and greets you:
```
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hey there, #{name}"
```

Now on your own, let's adapt it so that it asks for our middle and last name as well.


## Some More String Methods

[RUBY DOCS](http://www.ruby-doc.org/)

```
first_name = "Tim"
last_name = "Garcia"

# This is an example of String concatentation
# full name will be "Tim Garcia"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

# This is an example of String interpolation
full_name = "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# Returns the length of the string
full_name.length
# Also returns the length of the string literal
"Tim Garcia".length

# Returns full name but all characters in lower case.
# This does not save any changes to full_name iteself
full_name.downcase

# This will still print "Tim Garcia"
puts full_name

# Saves the downcased value of the string to full_name. 
full_name.downcase!

# This will print "tim garcia", because of the call to downcase!
puts full_name

# String access.  full_name is once again Tim Garcia
full_name[0] = 'T'
full_name[4] = 'G'

# Will print 'a' to STDOUT.  'a' is the last character in the full_name String
puts full_name[-1] 
```

#### Exercise
Let's add on to our greeter program.  Ask the user what city and state they live in.  Output the capitalized city name and all upercase state name.  Explore the Ruby docs to find out how to capitalize only the first letter.

**Code Along**
We'll make a simple app that asks the user how old they are.  It will then tell them how many seconds they have lived.

```
puts "How old are you?"
age = gets.chomp
age = age.to_i
seconds = age * 365 * 24 * 60 *60
puts "You've been alive for #{seconds} seconds"
```


#ARRAYS
Arrays are a data structure that can hold multiple objects.  It's basically a list of values.

```
my_array = []
another_array = Array.new
array_3 = [4, 6, 3, 1]
word_array = ["I", "like", "chocolate"]
array_of_arrays = [my_array, another_array, array_3, word_array]
```
**Accessing Arrays**

```
arr = ["Ruby", "is", "awesome"]
puts arr[0]
puts arr[2]
puts arr[-1]

```

**Modifying an array**

### Modifying an Array
Arrays can be modified by assigning a value directly to an index or by adding values or removing them from the object. 

```
arr = [1,2,99]

# Array is now [1,2,3]
arr[2] = 3

# This adds a new value to the end of the array
# Array is now [1,2,3,4]
arr[3] = 4
```

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# The array will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
arr.push 8
arr.push 9

# The array will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.pop
arr.pop
arr.pop
arr.pop

# The array will now be [3, 4, 5]
arr.shift
arr.shift

# The array will now be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.unshift 2
arr.unshift 1
```

Arrays can also be concatenated together.  For example, if you have array ```[1,2,3]``` and ```[4,5,6,]```.  You can use concat to add [4,5,6] to the array.

```
arr = [1,2,3]
arr.concat [4,5,6]

# Prints [1,2,3,4,5,6]
puts arr.to_s
```

Keep in mind that the array will take up space from index 0 to the last index that you create.  So the code below creates a large array of values that you probably do not want:

```
arr = []
arr[9999] = 1
```

### Code Along
We're going to make a program that stores a list of students in the class and then outputs them.

```
students = []
puts "Add a name"
students.push (gets.chomp)
puts "Add a name"
students.push (gets.chomp)
puts "Add a name"
students.push (gets.chomp)
p students
```

### **Exercise**

Make an app that asks the user for 5 numbers.  Store them in an array.  At the end, output the numbers from lowest to highest.  Look in the array documentation on Ruby Docs.

### Control Flow

**Objectives**
* If Statements
* Each Loops
* While Loops
* Exercises!

## Quick Review of Expressions
What's the difference?

```
x = 5
x == 5
```

Control flow uses **boolean expressions** to determine which code path to take.
Some basic control flow statements are below.

**We can make decisions!  Add logic to our code**

```
if something
  do something
end
```
So let's look a super basic example

```
puts "Hello, what's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello, #{name}"
if name == 'Colt'
  puts "What a great name! "
end
```
Now let's add **an else condition**

```
puts "Hello, what's your name? "
name = gets.chomp
puts "Hello, #{name}"
if name == 'Colt'
  puts "What a great name! "
else
  puts "That's a pretty good name too!"
end

```
**Open teacher.rb and have student walk me through it**

### **Elsif Statements**

```
num = 20
average = 50

if num < average
  puts "#{num} is below average"
elsif num > average
  puts  "#{num} is above average"
else
  puts  "#{num} is exactly average"
end

```
Since ruby is all about being human readable.  It also allows us to do one line control flow statements.

```
num = 10
max = 5

# Max is now 10
max = num if num > max
```
Also, since ruby is human readable, control flow statements generally have an opposite.  For if, the opposite is ```unless```

```
num = 1
min = 5

# Min is now 1
min = num unless num > min
```
Typically you use the control flow statements that sounds most natural in english.


**FIST TO FIVE**


### Exercise
Write a calculator program that takes a number, an operation +,-,/,*, then another number.  The program should be able to handle decimal numbers.  Below is sample output:

```
Enter a number, a +,-,/,*, then another number.
7
/ 
2
Result: 3.5
```

## Loops

Loops are essential to programming.  They allow us to repeat an operation many times.  Typically, execution of a loop lasts as long as a certain value holds true or as long as a set of data is being iterated over.  Below is an example of printing the values from 0 to 10 done using many different methods.  Note that 0..10 is a Range type, which was discussed earlier.




**Times do loops**

```
9.times do
  puts "HELLO"
end
```

**For Loops**

```
for i in 0..10
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
end
```

```
## Exercise: 99 bottles of beer
count = 99
while count > 0
  puts "#{count} bottles of beer on the wall"
  count = count -1
  puts "Take one down, pass it around #{count} bottles of beer on the wall"
end


```
# Iteration using a block
(0..10).each do |i|
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
end
```

```
# A more condensed way to iterate using a block.
(0..10).each { |i| puts "The value of i is now #{i}" }
```

```
# Iterating with a while loop
i = 0
num = 10

while i <= num do
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
  i += 1
end
```
## While Loops

```
command = ''

while command != 'bye'
  puts command
  command = gets.chomp
end

puts 'Come again soon!'
```

```
# Iterating until a value is true
i = 0
num = 10

until i > num
  puts "The value of i is now #{i}"
  i += 1
end
```

### Break
Break is a keyword that stops iteration of a loop.  In the example below, if i is equal to 6, then break is called. The output of the program will be 1 4 (each on separate lines).

```
arr = [1,4,6,9,24]
for i in arr
  break if i == 6
  puts i
end
```




***

### Exercises
#### Average
Given an array of numbers, find the average value.  You can write any array you like into your code.  Below is example output:
```
The average of [1, 4] is:
2.5
```

#### Sum
Write a program that asks the user for a number, then prints the sum of all the numbers between 0 and n incluse.  For example if the user enters 5, the program should sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.  Sample output is below:

```
Enter a number, N.  The sum of 0 to N will be printed.
2
3
```

```
Enter a number, N.  The sum of 0 to N will be printed.
5
15
```

# Appendix - Programs from Study hall
The programs below were used as in class exercises during the study hall.  They are added here for reference.

## Introduction
Write a program that introduces yourself to your neighbor.  The program should first ask your neighbor for his or her name and ask how many prework assignments they have completed.  Your program will then print the information back to the user along with a fun fact about yourself.  The output should look like this:

```
Hello, Jordan.  I'm Tim.  Nice to meet you.
I see you have completed 14 assignments.  I have completed 10 assignments"
In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee."
```
### Solution

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# Saving my friends name
puts "Hello, what is your name?"
friends_name = gets.chomp

# Saving the number of completed assignments
puts "How many prework assignments have you completed?"
completed_assignments = gets.chomp

# Putting to STDOUT
puts "Hello, #{friends_name}.  I'm Tim.  Nice to meet you"
puts "I see you have completed #{completed_assignments} assignments.  I have completed 1 assignment"
puts "In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee"
```

## Odd Or Even
Write a program that decides if a number is odd or even.

### Solution
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Please enter a number"
num = gets.to_i

if num % 2 == 0
  puts "#{num} is even"
else
  puts "#{num} is odd"
end
```

## Reverse a Word
Given a word from the user.  Reverse the word and print it back to the user.

### Solution

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Enter a string to reverse"
puts gets.chomp.reverse
```

## Calculator
Write a simple calculator program.  It should take as input, a number [enter], a + or - sign [enter], then another number.  The expressionw should then be evaluated and displayed to the user.  Below is sample input

```
Enter a number, a + or - sign, then another number
5
-
3
Result: 2
```

### Solution
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# A calculator program  that only understands addition and subtraction

puts "Enter a number, a + or - sign, then another number"

# Getting our input.  The program only supports simple 2 term expressions
num1 = gets.to_i

sign = gets.chomp

num2 = gets.to_i

if sign == "+"
  puts "Result: #{num1 + num2}"
elsif sign == "-"
  puts "Result: #{num1 - num2}"
else
  puts "Please re-read the instructions"
end
```

## Find Max
Find the maximum value in a array.

### Solution

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

arr = [1,3,9,5,34,99,20,-35,9]

max = arr[0]

arr.each do |i|
  if i > max
    max = i
  end 
end

puts "The maximum value in the array is #{max}"
```

## Palindrome
Write a program that decides if a word entered by the user is a palindrome.  A palindrome is a word that is the same when spelled forward or in reverse.  For example, wow is a palindrome.  It is the same string when reversed.

### Solution
```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

puts "Enter a word.  We'll see if it's a palindrome"
word = gets.chomp

if word == word.reverse
  puts "#{word} is a palindrome"
else
  puts "#{word} is NOT a palindrome"
end
```

#JavaScript Array

  

### What are JavaScript Arrays?

```js

2Array.prototype.push()

3Array.prototype.indexOf()

4Array.prototype.slice()

5Array.prototype.toString()

6Array.prototype.filter()

7Array.prototype.join()

8Array.prototype.splice()

9Array.prototype.forEach()

10Array.prototype.concat()

11Array.prototype.shift()

12Array.prototype.unshift()

13Array.prototype.map()

14Array.prototype.sort()

15Array.prototype.pop()

16Array.prototype.reduce()

17Array.prototype.some()

18Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()

19Array.prototype.reduceRight()

20Array.prototype.every()

21Array.prototype.reverse()

```

  
  
  
  
  
  

## In JavaScript, an Array represents an ordered collection of values.

  

>The array consists of one or more elements, each having a numbered position inside of the array. This is also called the index. Any given array element can hold any type offered by the JavaScript language. In other words, you can mix and match the various types inside of the same array. Just like most programming languages, arrays in JavaScript are zero based. This means they start at 0 and move up from there. Arrays in JavaScript grow and shrink like magic. That is to say, you do not have to specify the array size ahead of time before placing values in the array. As you add elements, the array dynamically grows for you. The same happens when you remove elements. All JavaScript arrays have a link to Array.prototype which is how we get access to all of the very useful functions we'll cover here in this tutorial. In true JavaScript style, these functions work not only on any array, but also any "array-like" object.

  

## 2. Array.prototype.push()

  

>array.push(element1, …, elementN)

  

#### Overview

>The push() function appends the arguments given to it, in order, to the end of the array. It modifies the array directly, rather than creating a new array.

  

#### What push() returns

>When you make a call to push(), it returns the total number of items in the array, after any provided arguments have been added to the end of the array.

  

#### array.push() function examples

`

``js

let characters = ['Darth Vader', 'Yoda', 'Boba Fett'];

  

let total = characters.push('Luke Skywalker', 'Han Solo');

  

console.log(characters); // ["Darth Vader", "Yoda", "Boba Fett", "Luke Skywalker", "Han Solo"]

  

console.log(total); // 5

```

  

3. Array.prototype.indexOf()

array.indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex = 0,fromIndex=0)

  

Overview

The JavaScript indexOf() function searches an array for an element that contains a specific value, then returns the very first index that contains that value. You can provide a starting index to the function if you like, otherwise searching will begin from index 0.

  

What indexOf() returns

The lowest index that is greater than or equal to the start of the array at which the element is equal to the given value. If no match is found, the indexOf() function returns -1.

  

array.indexOf() function examples

let starwars = ['Episode 4: A New Hope',

  

'Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back',

  

'Episode 6: Return of the Jedi',

  

'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace',

  

'Episode 2: Attack of the Clones',

  

'Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith',

  

'Episode 7: The Force Awakens'];

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 7: The Force Awakens')); // 6

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith')); // 5

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 2: Attack of the Clones', 3)); // 4

  

console.log(starwars.indexOf('Episode 1: The Phantom Menace', -4)); // 3

  

let locatedat = [];

  

let enemies = ['Kylo Ren', 'Darth Vader', 'Storm Trooper', 'General Hux', 'Emperor Palpatine', 'Storm Trooper'];

  

let enemy = 'Storm Trooper';

  

let enemylocation = enemies.indexOf(enemy);

  

while (enemylocation != -1) {

  

locatedat.push(enemylocation);

  

enemylocation = enemies.indexOf(enemy, enemylocation + 1);

  

}

  

console.log(locatedat); // 2, 5

  

The example above is a little more tricky. We have an array of enemies, and there might be multiple of a given enemy. By making use of indexOf(), we can find all instances of 'Storm Trooper' in our array of enemies. Running the code shows us that we have found a Storm Trooper at index 2 and index 5 of our array.

  

function theGoodSide(goodguys, goodguy) {

  

if (goodguys.indexOf(goodguy) === -1) {

  

goodguys.push(goodguy);

  

console.log('The new goodguys are ' + goodguys);

  

} else if (goodguys.indexOf(goodguy) > -1) {

  

console.log(goodguy + ' is already part of the goodguys.');

  

}

  

}

  

let thegoodguys = ['Luke Skywalker', 'Han Solo', 'Princess Leia'];

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Han Solo'); // Han Solo is already part of the goodguys.

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Yoda'); // The new goodguys are Luke Skywalker,Han Solo,Princess Leia,Yoda

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Ben Kenobi'); // The new goodguys are Luke Skywalker,Han Solo,Princess Leia,Yoda,Ben Kenobi

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'R2-D2'); // The new goodguys are Luke Skywalker,Han Solo,Princess Leia,Yoda,Ben Kenobi,R2-D2

  

theGoodSide(thegoodguys, 'Luke Skywalker'); // Luke Skywalker is already part of the goodguys.

  

This example makes use of a custom function that we can use to make sure our good guys are all accounted for. We check to see if the character exists in our collection, and if not, we add them to our good side.

  

4. Array.prototype.slice()

array.slice(ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 6: begin\̲[̲, end])

  

Overview

The JavaScript slice() function takes a start and end argument. It uses these start and end points to reach into the array, and remove a specific number of elements. The position you reference by start is included in the results, but the end is not included. In other words all elements are returned from the start right up to, but not including the end element. If you do not provide an end value, slice() will return the rest of the array starting from the given starting point. The original array is left in tact.

  

What slice() returns

The slice() function returns a new array that contains all of the elements of the original array from the element specified by the starting point provided, and up to but not including, the element specified by the ending point provided.

  

array.slice() function examples

let vaderparts = ['helmet', 'left arm', 'right arm', 'left leg', 'right leg'];

  

let chopped = vaderparts.slice(2,3);

  

console.log(chopped); // right arm

  

5. Array.prototype.toString()

array.toString()

  

The toString() function converts all elements in an array to strings and outputs one big string as a comma separated list of items.

  

array.toString() function examples

let spacecraft = ['X Wing', 'Death Star', 'Millenium Falcon', 'Jedi Interceptor'];

  

let allspacecraft = spacecraft.toString();

  

console.log(allspacecraft);

  

// X Wing,Death Star,Millenium Falcon,Jedi Interceptor

  

6. Array.prototype.filter()

array.filter(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

The JavaScript filter() function is very useful for doing exactly what it says, filtering down a collection of elements based on a given test. When you call the filter() function, you need to pass it a callback. This callback is executed against every element in the array. If that callback results in a true value, that particular element is added to a new array. The original array is left unchanged.

  

What filter() returns

filter() returns a new array that contains only the elements of the original array that returned true when the provided callback ran.

  

array.filter() function examples

let summer = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80].filter(function niceweather(temperature) {

  

return temperature >= 70;

  

});

  

console.log(summer); // 70, 80

  
  
  

let spacecraft = [

  

{name: 'Tie Fighter', speed: 200000},

  

{name: 'Super Star Destroyer', speed: 300000},

  

{name: 'Death Star', speed: 400000},

  

{name: 'T65 X Wing Star fighter', speed: 500000},

  

{name: 'T47 Air (snow) Speeder', speed: 600000},

  

{name: '74-Z Speeder Bike', speed: 700000},

  

{name: 'Millenium Falcon', speed: 800000}

  

];

  

function filterBySpeed(spacecraft) {

  

return spacecraft.speed > 450000;

  

}

  

let fleet = spacecraft.filter(filterBySpeed);

  

fleet.forEach(function (craft) {

  

console.log(craft.name);

  

});

  

// T65 X Wing Star fighter

  

// T47 Air (snow) Speeder

  

// 74-Z Speeder Bike

  

// Millenium Falcon

  

7. Array.prototype.join()

string = array.join(separator = ','separator=′,′)

  

Overview

The join() function converts each element of an array to a string and then concatenates those strings together. If the separator string was provided, it gets inserted between all elements in the final string.

  

What join() returns

The string that results from converting each element of the original array to a string and then joining them together, with the separator string between elements.

  

array.join() function examples

let wisdom = ['Yoda Says', 'Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.'];

  

wisdom = wisdom.join(': ');

  

console.log(wisdom);

  

// Yoda Says: Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

  

let wisdom = ['Do. Or do not. There is no try', 'Luminous beings are we…not this crude matter', 'Wars not make one great', 'Judge me by my size, do you?', 'Truly wonderful, the mind of a child is'];

  

let wisdom = wisdom.join(' <=***=> ');

8. Array.prototype.splice()

array.splice(start, deleteCountParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 8: , item1\̲[̲, item2\[, …]])

  

Overview

The splice() function deletes zero or more elements beginning from the provided start location, and replaces those elements with zero or more new values that were provided. Existing items in the array are shifted as needed to make room for any added or deleted elements. The thing to remember about the splice() function, is that it does modify the original array directly.

  

Returns

An array which contains any elements that may have been deleted from the array.

  

array.splice() function examples

  

```js

let darkSide = ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Boba Fett', 'Emperor Palpatine'];

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 0 elements from index 2, and inserts 'Jabba the Hutt'

  

let removed = darkSide.splice(2, 0, 'Jabba the Hutt');

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Jabba the Hutt', 'Boba Fett', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// [], no elements removed

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 1 element from index 3

  

removed = darkSide.splice(3, 1);

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Jabba the Hutt', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Boba Fett']

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 1 element from index 2, and inserts 'Darth Maul'

  

removed = darkSide.splice(2, 1, 'Darth Maul');

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin', 'Darth Maul', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Jabba the Hutt']

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 2 elements from index 0, and inserts 'Count Dooku', 'General Grievous' and 'Asajj Ventress'

  

removed = darkSide.splice(0, 2, 'Count Dooku', 'General Grievous', 'Asajj Ventress');

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Count Dooku', 'General Grievous', 'Asajj Ventress', 'Darth Maul', 'Emperor Palpatine']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Darth Vader', 'Grand Moff Tarkin']

  

//-----------------------------------------------------//

  

// removes 2 elements from index 3

  

removed = darkSide.splice(3, darkSide.length);

  

console.log(darkSide);

  

// ['Count Dooku', 'General Grievous', 'Asajj Ventress']

  

console.log(removed);

  

// ['Darth Maul', 'Emperor Palpatine']

```

  

# 9. Array.prototype.forEach()

array.forEach(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

### Overview

>The forEach() function executes a provided function on each element of the array. forEach() has no return value and does not return the original array. forEach() is related to the map(), filter(), every(), and some() functions and as such they share some related details. They all expect a callback function as the first argument. The optional second argument is a way to specify the this value for the callback function. All of these functions check the length of the array before looping. If the provided callback adds elements to the array during it's execution, those elements are not included for looping by the forEach(). Also of interesting note is that if the callback changes values in the original array before they are looped over, those changed values will be passed during their callback execution. You can also check out the Higher Order Functions In JavaScript tutorial.

10. Array.prototype.concat()

let new_array = old_array.concat(value1ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 9: , value2\̲[̲, …\[, valueN]])

  

Overview

concat() is a function that creates a new array which is the result of adding the supplied arguments to the original array. The original array is left intact, and the new array is the original plus any added elements. If any of the arguments to the concat() function are themselves an array, then the elements of that supplied array are added, rather than the entire array itself.

  

Returns

A new array, which is created by adding each of the supplied arguments to the original array.

  

array.concat() function examples

let legoStarWarsGames = ['Empire Vs Rebels', 'Ultimate Rebel', 'The Quest for R2-D2'];

  

let legoStarWarsSets = [10188, 75111, 75110, 75109];

  

let gamesAndSets = legoStarWarsGames.concat(legoStarWarsSets);

  

console.log(gamesAndSets);

  

// ["Empire Vs Rebels", "Ultimate Rebel", "The Quest for R2-D2", 10188, 75111, 75110, 75109]

  

let legoStarWarsGames = ['Empire Vs Rebels', 'Ultimate Rebel', 'The Quest for R2-D2'];

  

let legoStarWarsSets = [10188, 75111, 75110, 75109];

  

let availablePlatforms = ['Wii', 'Xbox', 'Playstation'];

  

let gamesSetsPlatforms = legoStarWarsGames.concat(legoStarWarsSets, availablePlatforms);

  

console.log(gamesSetsPlatforms);

  

// ["Empire Vs Rebels", "Ultimate Rebel", "The Quest for R2-D2", 10188, 75111, 75110, 75109, "Wii", "Xbox", "Playstation"]

  

11. Array.prototype.shift()

array.shift()

  

Overview

The shift() function removes and returns the first element of the original array. All remaining elements in the array get shifted one slot to the left in order to fill the hole created by removing the first element. If you try to apply this function to an empty array, it will do nothing and simply return undefined. The shift() function does not create a new array, it modifies the original array directly.

  

Returns

shift() returns the first element from the original array.

  

array.shift() function examples

let starWarsCreatures = ['Tach', 'Kath hound', 'Ruggers', 'Spice spider'];

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures before: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// "starWarsCreatures before: Tach,Kath hound,Ruggers,Spice spider"

  

let shifted = starWarsCreatures.shift();

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// "starWarsCreatures after: Kath hound,Ruggers,Spice spider"

  

console.log('Removed this element: ' + shifted);

  

// "Removed this element: Tach"

  

12. Array.prototype.unshift()

array.unshift(ParseError: KaTeX parse error: Undefined control sequence: \[ at position 9: element1\̲[̲, …\[, elementN]])

  

Overview

A direct opposite to the shift() function which we just discussed, is the unshift() function. unshift() inserts any arguments you pass to it into the beginning of the array. All of the existing elements need to shift to the right in order to make room for the new elements. Each argument passed to unshift() gets added in order starting from index 0. In addition, unshift() is modifying the original array directly.

  

Returns

The new length of the array.

  

array.unshift() function examples

let starWarsCreatures = ['Eopie', 'Acklay', 'Talortai', 'Boma'];

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures before: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures before: Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

let newcount = starWarsCreatures.unshift('Climbing tauntaun');

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures after: Climbing tauntaun,Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

console.log('The array now has: ' + newcount + ' elements');

  

// The array now has: 5 elements

  



  

21

  

let starWarsCreatures = ['Eopie', 'Acklay', 'Talortai', 'Boma'];

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures before: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures before: Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

let newcount = starWarsCreatures.unshift('Climbing tauntaun');

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures after: Climbing tauntaun,Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

console.log('The array now has: ' + newcount + ' elements');

  

// The array now has: 5 elements

  

newcount = starWarsCreatures.unshift(['Gullipuds', 'Mynock']);

  

console.log('starWarsCreatures after: ' + starWarsCreatures);

  

// starWarsCreatures after: Gullipuds,Mynock,Climbing tauntaun,Eopie,Acklay,Talortai,Boma

  

console.log('The array now has: ' + newcount + ' elements');

  

// The array now has: 6 elements

  

13. Array.prototype.map()

array.map(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

This is a very useful JavaScript function, and made use of all the time in professional software. The map() function loops over every element in the array, executing a callback function on each item. Once map() has completed looping through the array, it takes the results from each callback applied to each element, and returns those results in their entirety as an array. You are left with a new array with updated values, and an old array which has the original values. These two arrays are equal in length. When the callback is invoked, it is done so with three arguments. Those are the value of the element, the index of the element, and the Array object being traversed. If the optional second parameter is provided to map(), it will be used as the this value for each execution of the callback.

  

note: The map() and forEach() functions seem like they are the same, but they are in fact different. The difference is that forEach() iterates over an array and applies some operation with side effects to each array member such as saving each one to the database, or some other side effect. map() on the other hand iterates over an array, updates each member of that array, and returns another array of the same size with the transformed members (such as converting an array of strings to all lowercase).

  

Returns

map() returns a new array with elements computed by the provided callback function.

  

array.map() function examples

let starwars = ['star wars', 'the phantom menace', 'the force awakens'];

  

let swModified = starwars.map(function (element) {

  

return element.toUpperCase();

  

});

  

console.log(swModified);

  

// ["STAR WARS", "THE PHANTOM MENACE", "THE FORCE AWAKENS"]

  

let one = [3, 5, 7];

  

let two = one.map(function (number) {

  

return number * number;

  

});

  

console.log(one); // [3, 5, 7]

  

console.log(two); // [9, 25, 49]

  

let str = 'The Clone Wars';

  

let arr = Array.prototype.map.call(str, function (el) {

  

return el;

  

});

  

console.log(str); // The Clone Wars

  

console.log(arr); // ["T", "h", "e", " ", "C", "l", "o", "n", "e", " ", "W", "a", "r", "s"]

  

14. Array.prototype.sort()

array.sort(compareFunctioncompareFunction)

  

Overview

If you want to sort an array in JavaScript, then you can do so with the built in sort() function. sort() applies the sort directly to the original array, no copy of the array is made. You can optionally provide a callback function that will determine the behavior of the sort. If you do not provide one, the sort() function will first convert all elements to strings, and then sort based on something called the Unicode code point value. Basically that means alphabetical, but with some special rules such as capital letters coming before lowercase.

  

Returns

sort() returns a reference to the original array.

  

array.sort() function examples



  

21

  

let creatures = ['Pug jumper', 'Rong boars', 'Wamba', 'Oslet'];

  

creatures.sort(); //

  

let nums = [1, 10, 2, 21, 33, 04, 12, 09, 300];

  

nums.sort(); // [1, 10, 2, 21]

  

// Watch out that 10 comes before 2,

  

// because '10' comes before '2' in Unicode code point order.

  

let spacecraft = ['Lambda Class Shuttle', 'imperial landing craft', '4 Tantive'];

  

spacecraft.sort();

  

// In Unicode, numbers come before upper case letters,

  

// which come before lower case letters.

  

console.log(creatures);

  

// ["Oslet", "Pug jumper", "Rong boars", "Wamba"]

  

console.log(nums);

  

// [1, 10, 12, 2, 21, 300, 33, 4, 9]

  

console.log(spacecraft);

  

// ["4 Tantive", "Lambda Class Shuttle", "imperial landing craft"]

  

As we can see from the above example, when you do not supply a callback function to the sort method, ordering may not be what you expect. The rules for ordering in Unicode are a bit unique. For example, numbers come before upper case letters and uppercase letters come before lowercase letters. In addition, an array of numbers is converted to strings before sorting, so this is why we see 33 coming before 4 and 9 in the example above. Here is a callback function example to show ordering numbers how you might expect.

  

let nums = [1, 10, 2, 21, 33, 04, 12, 09, 300];

  

nums.sort(numsasexpected);

  

function numsasexpected(one, two) {

  

return one - two;

  

}

  

console.log(nums);

  

// [1, 2, 4, 9, 10, 12, 21, 33, 300]

  

15. Array.prototype.pop()

array.pop()

  

Overview

The opposite of the push() function would be the pop() function. The pop() function removes the last element from an array, decrements the length of the array, and returns the value which was removed from the array. If you try to apply the pop() to an empty array, you will simply get undefined returned.

  

Returns

pop() returns the last element of the array it is called on.

  

array.pop() function examples



  

let usefulFunctions = ['push', 'indexOf', 'slice', 'toString', 'filter', 'join'];

  

console.log('usefulFunctions initially has: ' + usefulFunctions);

  

// usefulFunctions initially has: push,indexOf,slice,toString,filter,join

  

let firstpop = usefulFunctions.pop();

  

console.log('after one pop, usefulFunctions has: ' + usefulFunctions);

  

// after one pop, usefulFunctions has: push,indexOf,slice,toString,filter

  

let poptwo = usefulFunctions.pop();

  

console.log('after two pops, usefulFunctions has: ' + usefulFunctions);

  

// after two pops, usefulFunctions has: push,indexOf,slice,toString

  

console.log('popone contains: ' + firstpop);

  

// popone contains: join

  

console.log('poptwo contains: ' + poptwo);

  

// poptwo contains: filter

  

16. Array.prototype.reduce()

array.reduce(callback, initialValue,initialValue)

  

Overview

reduce() accepts a function as the first parameter which acts like a binary operator. This callback function takes two values, operates on them, and returns a result. The number of times the callback function runs is always one less than the total length of the original array. For example if the original array has a length of 10, the callback will run 9 times. The final result is one combined value.

  

Returns

The reduced value of the array, which is the return value of the last time the callback function is executed.

  

array.reduce() function examples

In this example, we will use array.reduce() to operate on values contained within a simple array of objects. array.reduce() is a little more challenging than some of the other useful array functions, so spend some extra time on this one if it doesn't click immediately.

17. Array.prototype.some()

array.some(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

As we can see from the signature above, the some() function takes a callback as the first argument, and an optional second argument. The second argument, if provided, specifies the this value for invocations of the supplied callback. The some() function runs the provided callback on each element in the array, and if the callback returns true, then the some() function stops right away and returns true. If all callback iterations return false, then some() returns false.

  

Returns

some() either returns true or false. At least one item in the array must return true when the callback is applied in order for some() to return true.

  

array.some() function examples

function jsarrayfuncs(element, index, array) {

  

return element === 'javascript array functions';

  

}

  

let one = ['the good parts', 'the better parts', 'has no parts', 'atwood loves php'];

  

let two = ['life is good', 'arrays for all', 'node for win', 'javascript array functions'];

  

console.log(one.some(jsarrayfuncs)); // false

  

console.log(two.some(jsarrayfuncs)); // true

  

18. Array.prototype.lastIndexOf()

array.lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex = arr.length – 1,fromIndex=arr.length–1)

  

Overview

The lastIndexOf() function searches through an array backwards for a supplied value. Once the function finds that value, it returns the index position of where that value exists in the array. If you provide the optional second argument to the lastIndexOf() function, searching will begin from that starting point and go backwards. If you do not supply this second argument, searching starts at the end of the array. If no match is found, -1 is returned.

  

Returns

The highest index position that is less than or equal to the start of the array where the element is === to the value you are looking for, or -1 if there are no matches found.

  

array.lastIndexOf() function examples

let starwars = ['Episode 4: A New Hope',

  

'Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back',

  

'Episode 6: Return of the Jedi',

  

'Episode 1: The Phantom Menace',

  

'Episode 2: Attack of the Clones',

  

'Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith',

  

'Episode 7: The Force Awakens'];

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 7: The Force Awakens')); // 6

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith')); // 5

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 2: Attack of the Clones', 3)); // -1

  

console.log(starwars.lastIndexOf('Episode 1: The Phantom Menace', -4)); // 3

  

let locatedat = [];

  

let enemies = ['Kylo Ren', 'Darth Vader', 'Storm Trooper', 'General Hux', 'Emperor Palpatine', 'Storm Trooper'];

  

let enemy = 'Storm Trooper';

  

let enemylocation = enemies.lastIndexOf(enemy);

  

while (enemylocation != -1) {

  

locatedat.push(enemylocation);

  

enemylocation = enemies.lastIndexOf(enemy, enemylocation - 1);

  

}

  

console.log(locatedat); // 5, 2

  

19. Array.prototype.reduceRight()

array.reduceRight(callback, initialValue,initialValue)

  

Overview

The reduceRight() function works just like reduce() with one key difference. reduceRight() enumerates array elements from right to left (from highest index to lowest) rather than left to right (lowest to highest).

  

array.reduceRight() function example

let sum = [0, 10, 20, 30].reduceRight(function (one, two) {

  

return one + two;

  

});

  

console.log(sum); // 60

  

let flat = [[0, 10], [20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4]], [40, 50]].reduceRight(function (one, two) {

  

return one.concat(two);

  

}, []);

  

console.log(flat);

  

// [40, 50, 20, 30, [1, 2, 3, 4], 0, 10]

  

20. Array.prototype.every()

array.every(callback, thisArg,thisArg)

  

Overview

You can use the every() function to test whether a condition is true for all elements in an array. As like with most looping functions in JavaScript, you are expected to provide a callback function which will run on each element in the array from lowest to highest index. If all iterations return true when the callback runs, then the every() function itself will return true. If however an interation of the callback returns a false value, then every() stops right away and returns false.

  

array.every() function example

function greaterThan100(element, index, array) {

  

return element > 100;

  

}

  

arr1 = [200, 150, 550, 300, 101];

  

arr2 = [330, 120, 100, 508, 102];

  

console.log(arr1.every(greaterThan100)); // true

  

console.log(arr2.every(greaterThan100)); // false

  

Array.prototype.reverse()

array.reverse()

  

Overview

The reverse() function does exactly what you think it would do. It reverses the order of the elements of they array it is applied to. The reverse() function does this right on the original array, no new array is created or returned. In addition keep in mind that if there are many references to a particular array in your program, and you reverse that array, all references now also see an array which has been reversed. Perhaps that is why this function appears lower on our most useful JavaScript array functions list. Remember, the lower on the list a function appears, the less times we found it in use in popular open source software.

  

array.reverse() function example

let javascriptArray = ['eat', 'sleep', 'breathe', 'javascript'];

  

javascriptArray.reverse();

  

console.log(javascriptArray);

  

// ["javascript", "breathe", "sleep", "eat"]

  

Most Useful JavaScript Array Functions Summary

In this episode we took a look at all of the many useful JavaScript Array Functions you're likely to make use of and find helpful during your JavaScript programming. We used a method of analyzing popular JavaScript source code repositories hosted on Github, the well known open source software sharing and collaboration website. We found that the most useful JavaScript functions according to the number of times they were used in popular JavaScript frameworks to be Array.push(), Array.indexOf(), Array.slice(), Array.toString(), Array.filter(), Array.join(), Array.splice(), Array.forEach(), Array.concat(), Array.shift(), Array.unshift(), Array.map(), Array.sort(), Array.pop(), Array.reduce(), Array.some(), Array.lastIndexOf(), Array.reduceRight(), Array.every(), and finally, Array.reverse(). It would make sense to memorize as many of these as you can, or at least be very familiar with the ones that appear at the top of the list.

Advanced Formatting in GitHub Markdown
======================================

GitHub Flavored Markdown lets you create useful documents in [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitHub Enterprise](https://enterprise.github.com/home) using `.md` files.
Like other varieties of markdown, GitHub Markdown tries to be as readable as possible in its raw form, resulting in an intentionally limited set of formatting options.
However, these options can feel restrictive when dealing with complex content.

Although GitHub Markdown strips out most HTML tags, here are a few tricks that can give you more flexibility when formatting your documents.
These advanced formatting options can make your documents more useable, but they come at the expense of plain text readability, so use with caution.

Check out this excellent [cheatsheet](https://enterprise.github.com/downloads/en/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf) for an overview of standard formatting in GitHub Markdown.

# Child process | Node.js v15.12.0 Documentation

> Source Code: lib/child_process.js

**Source Code:** [lib/child\_process.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v15.12.0/lib/child_process.js)

The `child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability is primarily provided by the [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) function:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
    
    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });

By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }` option if the output will not be consumed.

The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment variable if it is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is used.

On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing objects to the `env` option that have multiple variants of the same key, such as `PATH` and `Path`.

The [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) method spawns the child process asynchronously, without blocking the Node.js event loop. The [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options) function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.

For convenience, the `child_process` module provides a handful of synchronous and asynchronous alternatives to [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) and [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options). Each of these alternatives are implemented on top of [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) or [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options).

*   [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback): spawns a shell and runs a command within that shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when complete.
*   [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback): similar to [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) except that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by default.
*   [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options): spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows sending messages between parent and child.
*   [`child_process.execSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options): a synchronous version of [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) that will block the Node.js event loop.
*   [`child_process.execFileSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execfilesync_file_args_options): a synchronous version of [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) that will block the Node.js event loop.

For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the [synchronous counterparts](#child_process_synchronous_process_creation) may be more convenient. In many cases, however, the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.

Asynchronous process creation[#](#child_process_asynchronous_process_creation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options), [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), and [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) methods all follow the idiomatic asynchronous programming pattern typical of other Node.js APIs.

Each of the methods returns a [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) instance. These objects implement the Node.js [`EventEmitter`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) API, allowing the parent process to register listener functions that are called when certain events occur during the life cycle of the child process.

The [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) and [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) methods additionally allow for an optional `callback` function to be specified that is invoked when the child process terminates.

### Spawning `.bat` and `.cmd` files on Windows[#](#child_process_spawning_bat_and_cmd_files_on_windows)

The importance of the distinction between [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) and [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) can vary based on platform. On Unix-type operating systems (Unix, Linux, macOS) [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) can be more efficient because it does not spawn a shell by default. On Windows, however, `.bat` and `.cmd` files are not executable on their own without a terminal, and therefore cannot be launched using [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback). When running on Windows, `.bat` and `.cmd` files can be invoked using [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) with the `shell` option set, with [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), or by spawning `cmd.exe` and passing the `.bat` or `.cmd` file as an argument (which is what the `shell` option and [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) do). In any case, if the script filename contains spaces it needs to be quoted.

    
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const bat = spawn('cmd.exe', ['/c', 'my.bat']);
    
    bat.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(data.toString());
    });
    
    bat.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(data.toString());
    });
    
    bat.on('exit', (code) => {
      console.log(`Child exited with code ${code}`);
    });

    
    const { exec, spawn } = require('child_process');
    exec('my.bat', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        return;
      }
      console.log(stdout);
    });
    
    
    const bat = spawn('"my script.cmd"', ['a', 'b'], { shell: true });
    
    exec('"my script.cmd" a b', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
      
    });

### `child_process.exec(command[, options][, callback])`[#](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback)

*   Returns: [<ChildProcess>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess)

Spawns a shell then executes the `command` within that shell, buffering any generated output. The `command` string passed to the exec function is processed directly by the shell and special characters (vary based on [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters)) need to be dealt with accordingly:

    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    
    exec('"/path/to/test file/test.sh" arg1 arg2');
    
    
    
    exec('echo "The \\$HOME variable is $HOME"');
    

**Never pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

If a `callback` function is provided, it is called with the arguments `(error, stdout, stderr)`. On success, `error` will be `null`. On error, `error` will be an instance of [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error). The `error.code` property will be the exit code of the process. By convention, any exit code other than `0` indicates an error. `error.signal` will be the signal that terminated the process.

The `stdout` and `stderr` arguments passed to the callback will contain the stdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode the output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The `encoding` option can be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and stderr output. If `encoding` is `'buffer'`, or an unrecognized character encoding, `Buffer` objects will be passed to the callback instead.

    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    exec('cat *.js missing_file | wc -l', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
        return;
      }
      console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
      console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
    });

If `timeout` is greater than `0`, the parent will send the signal identified by the `killSignal` property (the default is `'SIGTERM'`) if the child runs longer than `timeout` milliseconds.

Unlike the [`exec(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.exec()` does not replace the existing process and uses a shell to execute the command.

If this method is invoked as its [`util.promisify()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/util.html#util_util_promisify_original)ed version, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `stdout` and `stderr` properties. The returned `ChildProcess` instance is attached to the `Promise` as a `child` property. In case of an error (including any error resulting in an exit code other than 0), a rejected promise is returned, with the same `error` object given in the callback, but with two additional properties `stdout` and `stderr`.

    const util = require('util');
    const exec = util.promisify(require('child_process').exec);
    
    async function lsExample() {
      const { stdout, stderr } = await exec('ls');
      console.log('stdout:', stdout);
      console.error('stderr:', stderr);
    }
    lsExample();

If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:

    const { exec } = require('child_process');
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const { signal } = controller;
    const child = exec('grep ssh', { signal }, (error) => {
      console.log(error); 
    });
    controller.abort();

*   Returns: [<ChildProcess>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess)

The `child_process.execFile()` function is similar to [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) except that it does not spawn a shell by default. Rather, the specified executable `file` is spawned directly as a new process making it slightly more efficient than [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

The same options as [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) are supported. Since a shell is not spawned, behaviors such as I/O redirection and file globbing are not supported.

    const { execFile } = require('child_process');
    const child = execFile('node', ['--version'], (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        throw error;
      }
      console.log(stdout);
    });

The `stdout` and `stderr` arguments passed to the callback will contain the stdout and stderr output of the child process. By default, Node.js will decode the output as UTF-8 and pass strings to the callback. The `encoding` option can be used to specify the character encoding used to decode the stdout and stderr output. If `encoding` is `'buffer'`, or an unrecognized character encoding, `Buffer` objects will be passed to the callback instead.

If this method is invoked as its [`util.promisify()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/util.html#util_util_promisify_original)ed version, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `stdout` and `stderr` properties. The returned `ChildProcess` instance is attached to the `Promise` as a `child` property. In case of an error (including any error resulting in an exit code other than 0), a rejected promise is returned, with the same `error` object given in the callback, but with two additional properties `stdout` and `stderr`.

    const util = require('util');
    const execFile = util.promisify(require('child_process').execFile);
    async function getVersion() {
      const { stdout } = await execFile('node', ['--version']);
      console.log(stdout);
    }
    getVersion();

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

    *   `killSignal` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The signal value to be used when the spawned process will be killed by the abort signal. **Default:** `'SIGTERM'`.
    *   `silent` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) If `true`, stdin, stdout, and stderr of the child will be piped to the parent, otherwise they will be inherited from the parent, see the `'pipe'` and `'inherit'` options for [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options)'s [`stdio`](#child_process_options_stdio) for more details. **Default:** `false`.

*   Returns: [<ChildProcess>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/child_process.html#child_process_class_childprocess)

The `child_process.fork()` method is a special case of [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) used specifically to spawn new Node.js processes. Like [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), a [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object is returned. The returned [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) will have an additional communication channel built-in that allows messages to be passed back and forth between the parent and child. See [`subprocess.send()`](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) for details.

Keep in mind that spawned Node.js child processes are independent of the parent with exception of the IPC communication channel that is established between the two. Each process has its own memory, with their own V8 instances. Because of the additional resource allocations required, spawning a large number of child Node.js processes is not recommended.

By default, `child_process.fork()` will spawn new Node.js instances using the [`process.execPath`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_execpath) of the parent process. The `execPath` property in the `options` object allows for an alternative execution path to be used.

Node.js processes launched with a custom `execPath` will communicate with the parent process using the file descriptor (fd) identified using the environment variable `NODE_CHANNEL_FD` on the child process.

Unlike the [`fork(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) POSIX system call, `child_process.fork()` does not clone the current process.

The `shell` option available in [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) is not supported by `child_process.fork()` and will be ignored if set.

If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:

    if (process.argv[2] === 'child') {
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(`Hello from ${process.argv[2]}!`);
      }, 1_000);
    } else {
      const { fork } = require('child_process');
      const controller = new AbortController();
      const { signal } = controller;
      const child = fork(__filename, ['child'], { signal });
      child.on('error', (err) => {
        
      });
      controller.abort(); 
    }

The `child_process.spawn()` method spawns a new process using the given `command`, with command-line arguments in `args`. If omitted, `args` defaults to an empty array.

**If the `shell` option is enabled, do not pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

A third argument may be used to specify additional options, with these defaults:

    const defaults = {
      cwd: undefined,
      env: process.env
    };

Use `cwd` to specify the working directory from which the process is spawned. If not given, the default is to inherit the current working directory. If given, but the path does not exist, the child process emits an `ENOENT` error and exits immediately. `ENOENT` is also emitted when the command does not exist.

Use `env` to specify environment variables that will be visible to the new process, the default is [`process.env`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_env).

`undefined` values in `env` will be ignored.

Example of running `ls -lh /usr`, capturing `stdout`, `stderr`, and the exit code:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
    
    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });

Example: A very elaborate way to run `ps ax | grep ssh`

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ps = spawn('ps', ['ax']);
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
    
    ps.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      grep.stdin.write(data);
    });
    
    ps.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`ps stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ps.on('close', (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        console.log(`ps process exited with code ${code}`);
      }
      grep.stdin.end();
    });
    
    grep.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(data.toString());
    });
    
    grep.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      console.error(`grep stderr: ${data}`);
    });
    
    grep.on('close', (code) => {
      if (code !== 0) {
        console.log(`grep process exited with code ${code}`);
      }
    });

Example of checking for failed `spawn`:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const subprocess = spawn('bad_command');
    
    subprocess.on('error', (err) => {
      console.error('Failed to start subprocess.');
    });

Certain platforms (macOS, Linux) will use the value of `argv[0]` for the process title while others (Windows, SunOS) will use `command`.

Node.js currently overwrites `argv[0]` with `process.execPath` on startup, so `process.argv[0]` in a Node.js child process will not match the `argv0` parameter passed to `spawn` from the parent, retrieve it with the `process.argv0` property instead.

If the `signal` option is enabled, calling `.abort()` on the corresponding `AbortController` is similar to calling `.kill()` on the child process except the error passed to the callback will be an `AbortError`:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const controller = new AbortController();
    const { signal } = controller;
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh'], { signal });
    grep.on('error', (err) => {
      
    });
    controller.abort(); 

#### `options.detached`[#](#child_process_options_detached)

Added in: v0.7.10

On Windows, setting `options.detached` to `true` makes it possible for the child process to continue running after the parent exits. The child will have its own console window. Once enabled for a child process, it cannot be disabled.

On non-Windows platforms, if `options.detached` is set to `true`, the child process will be made the leader of a new process group and session. Child processes may continue running after the parent exits regardless of whether they are detached or not. See [`setsid(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html) for more information.

By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent the parent from waiting for a given `subprocess` to exit, use the `subprocess.unref()` method. Doing so will cause the parent's event loop to not include the child in its reference count, allowing the parent to exit independently of the child, unless there is an established IPC channel between the child and the parent.

When using the `detached` option to start a long-running process, the process will not stay running in the background after the parent exits unless it is provided with a `stdio` configuration that is not connected to the parent. If the parent's `stdio` is inherited, the child will remain attached to the controlling terminal.

Example of a long-running process, by detaching and also ignoring its parent `stdio` file descriptors, in order to ignore the parent's termination:

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: 'ignore'
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();

Alternatively one can redirect the child process' output into files:

    const fs = require('fs');
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const out = fs.openSync('./out.log', 'a');
    const err = fs.openSync('./out.log', 'a');
    
    const subprocess = spawn('prg', [], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: [ 'ignore', out, err ]
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();

#### `options.stdio`[#](#child_process_options_stdio)

The `options.stdio` option is used to configure the pipes that are established between the parent and child process. By default, the child's stdin, stdout, and stderr are redirected to corresponding [`subprocess.stdin`](#child_process_subprocess_stdin), [`subprocess.stdout`](#child_process_subprocess_stdout), and [`subprocess.stderr`](#child_process_subprocess_stderr) streams on the [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object. This is equivalent to setting the `options.stdio` equal to `['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']`.

For convenience, `options.stdio` may be one of the following strings:

*   `'pipe'`: equivalent to `['pipe', 'pipe', 'pipe']` (the default)
*   `'overlapped'`: equivalent to `['overlapped', 'overlapped', 'overlapped']`
*   `'ignore'`: equivalent to `['ignore', 'ignore', 'ignore']`
*   `'inherit'`: equivalent to `['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit']` or `[0, 1, 2]`

Otherwise, the value of `options.stdio` is an array where each index corresponds to an fd in the child. The fds 0, 1, and 2 correspond to stdin, stdout, and stderr, respectively. Additional fds can be specified to create additional pipes between the parent and child. The value is one of the following:

1.  `'pipe'`: Create a pipe between the child process and the parent process. The parent end of the pipe is exposed to the parent as a property on the `child_process` object as [`subprocess.stdio[fd]`](#child_process_subprocess_stdio). Pipes created for fds 0, 1, and 2 are also available as [`subprocess.stdin`](#child_process_subprocess_stdin), [`subprocess.stdout`](#child_process_subprocess_stdout) and [`subprocess.stderr`](#child_process_subprocess_stderr), respectively.
    
2.  `'overlapped'`: Same as `'pipe'` except that the `FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED` flag is set on the handle. This is necessary for overlapped I/O on the child process's stdio handles. See the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/synchronous-and-asynchronous-i-o) for more details. This is exactly the same as `'pipe'` on non-Windows systems.
    
3.  `'ipc'`: Create an IPC channel for passing messages/file descriptors between parent and child. A [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) may have at most one IPC stdio file descriptor. Setting this option enables the [`subprocess.send()`](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) method. If the child is a Node.js process, the presence of an IPC channel will enable [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) and [`process.disconnect()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_disconnect) methods, as well as [`'disconnect'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_disconnect) and [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) events within the child.
    
    Accessing the IPC channel fd in any way other than [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) or using the IPC channel with a child process that is not a Node.js instance is not supported.
    
4.  `'ignore'`: Instructs Node.js to ignore the fd in the child. While Node.js will always open fds 0, 1, and 2 for the processes it spawns, setting the fd to `'ignore'` will cause Node.js to open `/dev/null` and attach it to the child's fd.
    
5.  `'inherit'`: Pass through the corresponding stdio stream to/from the parent process. In the first three positions, this is equivalent to `process.stdin`, `process.stdout`, and `process.stderr`, respectively. In any other position, equivalent to `'ignore'`.
    
6.  [<Stream>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_stream) object: Share a readable or writable stream that refers to a tty, file, socket, or a pipe with the child process. The stream's underlying file descriptor is duplicated in the child process to the fd that corresponds to the index in the `stdio` array. The stream must have an underlying descriptor (file streams do not until the `'open'` event has occurred).
    
7.  Positive integer: The integer value is interpreted as a file descriptor that is currently open in the parent process. It is shared with the child process, similar to how [<Stream>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_stream) objects can be shared. Passing sockets is not supported on Windows.
    
8.  `null`, `undefined`: Use default value. For stdio fds 0, 1, and 2 (in other words, stdin, stdout, and stderr) a pipe is created. For fd 3 and up, the default is `'ignore'`.
    

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    
    spawn('prg', [], { stdio: 'inherit' });
    
    
    spawn('prg', [], { stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', process.stderr] });
    
    
    
    spawn('prg', [], { stdio: ['pipe', null, null, null, 'pipe'] });

_It is worth noting that when an IPC channel is established between the parent and child processes, and the child is a Node.js process, the child is launched with the IPC channel unreferenced (using `unref()`) until the child registers an event handler for the [`'disconnect'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_disconnect) event or the [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event. This allows the child to exit normally without the process being held open by the open IPC channel._

On Unix-like operating systems, the [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) method performs memory operations synchronously before decoupling the event loop from the child. Applications with a large memory footprint may find frequent [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) calls to be a bottleneck. For more information, see [V8 issue 7381](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=7381).

Synchronous process creation[#](#child_process_synchronous_process_creation)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options), [`child_process.execSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execsync_command_options), and [`child_process.execFileSync()`](#child_process_child_process_execfilesync_file_args_options) methods are synchronous and will block the Node.js event loop, pausing execution of any additional code until the spawned process exits.

Blocking calls like these are mostly useful for simplifying general-purpose scripting tasks and for simplifying the loading/processing of application configuration at startup.

The `child_process.execFileSync()` method is generally identical to [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback) with the exception that the method will not return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been encountered and `killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process has completely exited.

If the child process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal and does not exit, the parent process will still wait until the child process has exited.

If the process times out or has a non-zero exit code, this method will throw an [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error) that will include the full result of the underlying [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options).

The `child_process.execSync()` method is generally identical to [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) with the exception that the method will not return until the child process has fully closed. When a timeout has been encountered and `killSignal` is sent, the method won't return until the process has completely exited. If the child process intercepts and handles the `SIGTERM` signal and doesn't exit, the parent process will wait until the child process has exited.

If the process times out or has a non-zero exit code, this method will throw. The [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error) object will contain the entire result from [`child_process.spawnSync()`](#child_process_child_process_spawnsync_command_args_options).

**Never pass unsanitized user input to this function. Any input containing shell metacharacters may be used to trigger arbitrary command execution.**

Class: `ChildProcess`[#](#child_process_class_childprocess)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Added in: v2.2.0

*   Extends: [<EventEmitter>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)

Instances of the `ChildProcess` represent spawned child processes.

Instances of `ChildProcess` are not intended to be created directly. Rather, use the [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), [`child_process.execFile()`](#child_process_child_process_execfile_file_args_options_callback), or [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options) methods to create instances of `ChildProcess`.

### Event: `'close'`[#](#child_process_event_close)

Added in: v0.7.7

*   `code` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The exit code if the child exited on its own.
*   `signal` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The signal by which the child process was terminated.

The `'close'` event is emitted when the stdio streams of a child process have been closed. This is distinct from the [`'exit'`](#child_process_event_exit) event, since multiple processes might share the same stdio streams.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
    
    ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('close', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process close all stdio with code ${code}`);
    });
    
    ls.on('exit', (code) => {
      console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
    });

### Event: `'disconnect'`[#](#child_process_event_disconnect)

Added in: v0.7.2

The `'disconnect'` event is emitted after calling the [`subprocess.disconnect()`](#child_process_subprocess_disconnect) method in parent process or [`process.disconnect()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_disconnect) in child process. After disconnecting it is no longer possible to send or receive messages, and the [`subprocess.connected`](#child_process_subprocess_connected) property is `false`.

### Event: `'error'`[#](#child_process_event_error)

*   `err` [<Error>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) The error.

The `'error'` event is emitted whenever:

1.  The process could not be spawned, or
2.  The process could not be killed, or
3.  Sending a message to the child process failed.

The `'exit'` event may or may not fire after an error has occurred. When listening to both the `'exit'` and `'error'` events, guard against accidentally invoking handler functions multiple times.

See also [`subprocess.kill()`](#child_process_subprocess_kill_signal) and [`subprocess.send()`](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback).

### Event: `'exit'`[#](#child_process_event_exit)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   `code` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) The exit code if the child exited on its own.
*   `signal` [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) The signal by which the child process was terminated.

The `'exit'` event is emitted after the child process ends. If the process exited, `code` is the final exit code of the process, otherwise `null`. If the process terminated due to receipt of a signal, `signal` is the string name of the signal, otherwise `null`. One of the two will always be non-`null`.

When the `'exit'` event is triggered, child process stdio streams might still be open.

Node.js establishes signal handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` and Node.js processes will not terminate immediately due to receipt of those signals. Rather, Node.js will perform a sequence of cleanup actions and then will re-raise the handled signal.

See [`waitpid(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/waitpid.2.html).

### Event: `'message'`[#](#child_process_event_message)

Added in: v0.5.9

*   `message` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A parsed JSON object or primitive value.
*   `sendHandle` [<Handle>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_server_listen_handle_backlog_callback) A [`net.Socket`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_class_net_socket) or [`net.Server`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_class_net_server) object, or undefined.

The `'message'` event is triggered when a child process uses [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) to send messages.

The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting message might not be the same as what is originally sent.

If the `serialization` option was set to `'advanced'` used when spawning the child process, the `message` argument can contain data that JSON is not able to represent. See [Advanced serialization](#child_process_advanced_serialization) for more details.

### Event: `'spawn'`[#](#child_process_event_spawn)

Added in: v15.1.0

The `'spawn'` event is emitted once the child process has spawned successfully.

If emitted, the `'spawn'` event comes before all other events and before any data is received via `stdout` or `stderr`.

The `'spawn'` event will fire regardless of whether an error occurs **within** the spawned process. For example, if `bash some-command` spawns successfully, the `'spawn'` event will fire, though `bash` may fail to spawn `some-command`. This caveat also applies when using `{ shell: true }`.

### `subprocess.channel`[#](#child_process_subprocess_channel)

*   [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) A pipe representing the IPC channel to the child process.

The `subprocess.channel` property is a reference to the child's IPC channel. If no IPC channel currently exists, this property is `undefined`.

#### `subprocess.channel.ref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_channel_ref)

Added in: v7.1.0

This method makes the IPC channel keep the event loop of the parent process running if `.unref()` has been called before.

#### `subprocess.channel.unref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_channel_unref)

Added in: v7.1.0

This method makes the IPC channel not keep the event loop of the parent process running, and lets it finish even while the channel is open.

### `subprocess.connected`[#](#child_process_subprocess_connected)

Added in: v0.7.2

*   [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Set to `false` after `subprocess.disconnect()` is called.

The `subprocess.connected` property indicates whether it is still possible to send and receive messages from a child process. When `subprocess.connected` is `false`, it is no longer possible to send or receive messages.

### `subprocess.disconnect()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_disconnect)

Added in: v0.7.2

Closes the IPC channel between parent and child, allowing the child to exit gracefully once there are no other connections keeping it alive. After calling this method the `subprocess.connected` and `process.connected` properties in both the parent and child (respectively) will be set to `false`, and it will be no longer possible to pass messages between the processes.

The `'disconnect'` event will be emitted when there are no messages in the process of being received. This will most often be triggered immediately after calling `subprocess.disconnect()`.

When the child process is a Node.js instance (e.g. spawned using [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options)), the `process.disconnect()` method can be invoked within the child process to close the IPC channel as well.

### `subprocess.exitCode`[#](#child_process_subprocess_exitcode)

*   [<integer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type)

The `subprocess.exitCode` property indicates the exit code of the child process. If the child process is still running, the field will be `null`.

### `subprocess.kill([signal])`[#](#child_process_subprocess_kill_signal)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   `signal` [<number>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) | [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)
*   Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

The `subprocess.kill()` method sends a signal to the child process. If no argument is given, the process will be sent the `'SIGTERM'` signal. See [`signal(7)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html) for a list of available signals. This function returns `true` if [`kill(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html) succeeds, and `false` otherwise.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
    
    grep.on('close', (code, signal) => {
      console.log(
        `child process terminated due to receipt of signal ${signal}`);
    });
    
    
    grep.kill('SIGHUP');

The [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object may emit an [`'error'`](#child_process_event_error) event if the signal cannot be delivered. Sending a signal to a child process that has already exited is not an error but may have unforeseen consequences. Specifically, if the process identifier (PID) has been reassigned to another process, the signal will be delivered to that process instead which can have unexpected results.

While the function is called `kill`, the signal delivered to the child process may not actually terminate the process.

See [`kill(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/kill.2.html) for reference.

On Linux, child processes of child processes will not be terminated when attempting to kill their parent. This is likely to happen when running a new process in a shell or with the use of the `shell` option of `ChildProcess`:

    'use strict';
    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(
      'sh',
      [
        '-c',
        `node -e "setInterval(() => {
          console.log(process.pid, 'is alive')
        }, 500);"`,
      ], {
        stdio: ['inherit', 'inherit', 'inherit']
      }
    );
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      subprocess.kill(); 
    }, 2000);

### `subprocess.killed`[#](#child_process_subprocess_killed)

Added in: v0.5.10

*   [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) Set to `true` after `subprocess.kill()` is used to successfully send a signal to the child process.

The `subprocess.killed` property indicates whether the child process successfully received a signal from `subprocess.kill()`. The `killed` property does not indicate that the child process has been terminated.

### `subprocess.pid`[#](#child_process_subprocess_pid)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<integer>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type) | [<undefined>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Undefined_type)

Returns the process identifier (PID) of the child process. If the child process fails to spawn due to errors, then the value is `undefined` and `error` is emitted.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    const grep = spawn('grep', ['ssh']);
    
    console.log(`Spawned child pid: ${grep.pid}`);
    grep.stdin.end();

### `subprocess.ref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_ref)

Added in: v0.7.10

Calling `subprocess.ref()` after making a call to `subprocess.unref()` will restore the removed reference count for the child process, forcing the parent to wait for the child to exit before exiting itself.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: 'ignore'
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();
    subprocess.ref();

### `subprocess.send(message[, sendHandle[, options]][, callback])`[#](#child_process_subprocess_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback)

*   `message` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
*   `sendHandle` [<Handle>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/net.html#net_server_listen_handle_backlog_callback)
*   `options` [<Object>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) The `options` argument, if present, is an object used to parameterize the sending of certain types of handles. `options` supports the following properties:
    *   `keepOpen` [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type) A value that can be used when passing instances of `net.Socket`. When `true`, the socket is kept open in the sending process. **Default:** `false`.
*   `callback` [<Function>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
*   Returns: [<boolean>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

When an IPC channel has been established between the parent and child ( i.e. when using [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options)), the `subprocess.send()` method can be used to send messages to the child process. When the child process is a Node.js instance, these messages can be received via the [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event.

The message goes through serialization and parsing. The resulting message might not be the same as what is originally sent.

For example, in the parent script:

    const cp = require('child_process');
    const n = cp.fork(`${__dirname}/sub.js`);
    
    n.on('message', (m) => {
      console.log('PARENT got message:', m);
    });
    
    
    n.send({ hello: 'world' });

And then the child script, `'sub.js'` might look like this:

    process.on('message', (m) => {
      console.log('CHILD got message:', m);
    });
    
    
    process.send({ foo: 'bar', baz: NaN });

Child Node.js processes will have a [`process.send()`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_send_message_sendhandle_options_callback) method of their own that allows the child to send messages back to the parent.

There is a special case when sending a `{cmd: 'NODE_foo'}` message. Messages containing a `NODE_` prefix in the `cmd` property are reserved for use within Node.js core and will not be emitted in the child's [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event. Rather, such messages are emitted using the `'internalMessage'` event and are consumed internally by Node.js. Applications should avoid using such messages or listening for `'internalMessage'` events as it is subject to change without notice.

The optional `sendHandle` argument that may be passed to `subprocess.send()` is for passing a TCP server or socket object to the child process. The child will receive the object as the second argument passed to the callback function registered on the [`'message'`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_event_message) event. Any data that is received and buffered in the socket will not be sent to the child.

The optional `callback` is a function that is invoked after the message is sent but before the child may have received it. The function is called with a single argument: `null` on success, or an [`Error`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/errors.html#errors_class_error) object on failure.

If no `callback` function is provided and the message cannot be sent, an `'error'` event will be emitted by the [`ChildProcess`](#child_process_class_childprocess) object. This can happen, for instance, when the child process has already exited.

`subprocess.send()` will return `false` if the channel has closed or when the backlog of unsent messages exceeds a threshold that makes it unwise to send more. Otherwise, the method returns `true`. The `callback` function can be used to implement flow control.

#### Example: sending a server object[#](#child_process_example_sending_a_server_object)

The `sendHandle` argument can be used, for instance, to pass the handle of a TCP server object to the child process as illustrated in the example below:

    const subprocess = require('child_process').fork('subprocess.js');
    
    
    const server = require('net').createServer();
    server.on('connection', (socket) => {
      socket.end('handled by parent');
    });
    server.listen(1337, () => {
      subprocess.send('server', server);
    });

The child would then receive the server object as:

    process.on('message', (m, server) => {
      if (m === 'server') {
        server.on('connection', (socket) => {
          socket.end('handled by child');
        });
      }
    });

Once the server is now shared between the parent and child, some connections can be handled by the parent and some by the child.

While the example above uses a server created using the `net` module, `dgram` module servers use exactly the same workflow with the exceptions of listening on a `'message'` event instead of `'connection'` and using `server.bind()` instead of `server.listen()`. This is, however, currently only supported on Unix platforms.

#### Example: sending a socket object[#](#child_process_example_sending_a_socket_object)

Similarly, the `sendHandler` argument can be used to pass the handle of a socket to the child process. The example below spawns two children that each handle connections with "normal" or "special" priority:

    const { fork } = require('child_process');
    const normal = fork('subprocess.js', ['normal']);
    const special = fork('subprocess.js', ['special']);
    
    
    
    const server = require('net').createServer({ pauseOnConnect: true });
    server.on('connection', (socket) => {
    
      
      if (socket.remoteAddress === '74.125.127.100') {
        special.send('socket', socket);
        return;
      }
      
      normal.send('socket', socket);
    });
    server.listen(1337);

The `subprocess.js` would receive the socket handle as the second argument passed to the event callback function:

    process.on('message', (m, socket) => {
      if (m === 'socket') {
        if (socket) {
          
          
          
          socket.end(`Request handled with ${process.argv[2]} priority`);
        }
      }
    });

Do not use `.maxConnections` on a socket that has been passed to a subprocess. The parent cannot track when the socket is destroyed.

Any `'message'` handlers in the subprocess should verify that `socket` exists, as the connection may have been closed during the time it takes to send the connection to the child.

### `subprocess.signalCode`[#](#child_process_subprocess_signalcode)

*   [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type) | [<null>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Null_type)

The `subprocess.signalCode` property indicates the signal received by the child process if any, else `null`.

### `subprocess.spawnargs`[#](#child_process_subprocess_spawnargs)

*   [<Array>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

The `subprocess.spawnargs` property represents the full list of command-line arguments the child process was launched with.

### `subprocess.spawnfile`[#](#child_process_subprocess_spawnfile)

*   [<string>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type)

The `subprocess.spawnfile` property indicates the executable file name of the child process that is launched.

For [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options), its value will be equal to [`process.execPath`](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/process.html#process_process_execpath). For [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options), its value will be the name of the executable file. For [`child_process.exec()`](#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback), its value will be the name of the shell in which the child process is launched.

### `subprocess.stderr`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stderr)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<stream.Readable>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)

A `Readable Stream` that represents the child process's `stderr`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[2]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`, then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stderr` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[2]`. Both properties will refer to the same value.

The `subprocess.stderr` property can be `null` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.stdin`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stdin)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<stream.Writable>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)

A `Writable Stream` that represents the child process's `stdin`.

If a child process waits to read all of its input, the child will not continue until this stream has been closed via `end()`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[0]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`, then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stdin` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[0]`. Both properties will refer to the same value.

The `subprocess.stdin` property can be `undefined` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.stdio`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stdio)

Added in: v0.7.10

*   [<Array>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

A sparse array of pipes to the child process, corresponding with positions in the [`stdio`](#child_process_options_stdio) option passed to [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) that have been set to the value `'pipe'`. `subprocess.stdio[0]`, `subprocess.stdio[1]`, and `subprocess.stdio[2]` are also available as `subprocess.stdin`, `subprocess.stdout`, and `subprocess.stderr`, respectively.

In the following example, only the child's fd `1` (stdout) is configured as a pipe, so only the parent's `subprocess.stdio[1]` is a stream, all other values in the array are `null`.

    const assert = require('assert');
    const fs = require('fs');
    const child_process = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = child_process.spawn('ls', {
      stdio: [
        0, 
        'pipe', 
        fs.openSync('err.out', 'w'), 
      ]
    });
    
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[0], null);
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[0], subprocess.stdin);
    
    assert(subprocess.stdout);
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[1], subprocess.stdout);
    
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[2], null);
    assert.strictEqual(subprocess.stdio[2], subprocess.stderr);

The `subprocess.stdio` property can be `undefined` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.stdout`[#](#child_process_subprocess_stdout)

Added in: v0.1.90

*   [<stream.Readable>](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable)

A `Readable Stream` that represents the child process's `stdout`.

If the child was spawned with `stdio[1]` set to anything other than `'pipe'`, then this will be `null`.

`subprocess.stdout` is an alias for `subprocess.stdio[1]`. Both properties will refer to the same value.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn('ls');
    
    subprocess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(`Received chunk ${data}`);
    });

The `subprocess.stdout` property can be `null` if the child process could not be successfully spawned.

### `subprocess.unref()`[#](#child_process_subprocess_unref)

Added in: v0.7.10

By default, the parent will wait for the detached child to exit. To prevent the parent from waiting for a given `subprocess` to exit, use the `subprocess.unref()` method. Doing so will cause the parent's event loop to not include the child in its reference count, allowing the parent to exit independently of the child, unless there is an established IPC channel between the child and the parent.

    const { spawn } = require('child_process');
    
    const subprocess = spawn(process.argv[0], ['child_program.js'], {
      detached: true,
      stdio: 'ignore'
    });
    
    subprocess.unref();

`maxBuffer` and Unicode[#](#child_process_maxbuffer_and_unicode)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The `maxBuffer` option specifies the largest number of bytes allowed on `stdout` or `stderr`. If this value is exceeded, then the child process is terminated. This impacts output that includes multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16. For instance, `console.log('中文测试')` will send 13 UTF-8 encoded bytes to `stdout` although there are only 4 characters.

Shell requirements[#](#child_process_shell_requirements)
--------------------------------------------------------

The shell should understand the `-c` switch. If the shell is `'cmd.exe'`, it should understand the `/d /s /c` switches and command-line parsing should be compatible.

Default Windows shell[#](#child_process_default_windows_shell)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Although Microsoft specifies `%COMSPEC%` must contain the path to `'cmd.exe'` in the root environment, child processes are not always subject to the same requirement. Thus, in `child_process` functions where a shell can be spawned, `'cmd.exe'` is used as a fallback if `process.env.ComSpec` is unavailable.

Advanced serialization[#](#child_process_advanced_serialization)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Added in: v13.2.0, v12.16.0

Child processes support a serialization mechanism for IPC that is based on the [serialization API of the `v8` module](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/v8.html#v8_serialization_api), based on the [HTML structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm). This is generally more powerful and supports more built-in JavaScript object types, such as `BigInt`, `Map` and `Set`, `ArrayBuffer` and `TypedArray`, `Buffer`, `Error`, `RegExp` etc.

However, this format is not a full superset of JSON, and e.g. properties set on objects of such built-in types will not be passed on through the serialization step. Additionally, performance may not be equivalent to that of JSON, depending on the structure of the passed data. Therefore, this feature requires opting in by setting the `serialization` option to `'advanced'` when calling [`child_process.spawn()`](#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options) or [`child_process.fork()`](#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options).

### [_CONTAINER/psql-cheat-sheet/psql-cheat-sheet-2.md](_CONTAINER/psql-cheat-sheet/psql-cheat-sheet-2.md)

## PSQL

Magic words:
```bash
psql -U postgres
```
Some interesting flags (to see all, use `-h` or `--help` depending on your psql version):
- `-E`: will describe the underlaying queries of the `\` commands (cool for learning!)
- `-l`: psql will list all databases and then exit (useful if the user you connect with doesn't has a default database, like at AWS RDS)

Most `\d` commands support additional param of `__schema__.name__` and accept wildcards like `*.*`

- `\?`: Show help (list of available commands with an explanation)
- `\q`: Quit/Exit
- `\c __database__`: Connect to a database
- `\d __table__`: Show table definition (columns, etc.) including triggers
- `\d+ __table__`: More detailed table definition including description and physical disk size
- `\l`: List databases
- `\dy`: List events
- `\df`: List functions
- `\di`: List indexes
- `\dn`: List schemas
- `\dt *.*`: List tables from all schemas (if `*.*` is omitted will only show SEARCH_PATH ones)
- `\dT+`: List all data types
- `\dv`: List views
- `\dx`: List all extensions installed
- `\df+ __function__` : Show function SQL code. 
- `\x`: Pretty-format query results instead of the not-so-useful ASCII tables
- `\copy (SELECT * FROM __table_name__) TO 'file_path_and_name.csv' WITH CSV`: Export a table as CSV
- `\des+`: List all foreign servers
- `\dE[S+]`: List all foreign tables
- `\! __bash_command__`: execute `__bash_command__` (e.g. `\! ls`)

User Related:
- `\du`: List users
- `\du __username__`: List a username if present.
- `create role __test1__`: Create a role with an existing username.
- `create role __test2__ noinherit login password __passsword__;`: Create a role with username and password.
- `set role __test__;`: Change role for current session to `__test__`.
- `grant __test2__ to __test1__;`: Allow `__test1__` to set its role as `__test2__`.
- `\deu+`: List all user mapping on server

## Configuration

- Service management commands:
```
sudo service postgresql stop
sudo service postgresql start
sudo service postgresql restart
```

- Changing verbosity & querying Postgres log:
  <br/>1) First edit the config file, set a decent verbosity, save and restart postgres:
```
sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf

# Uncomment/Change inside:
log_min_messages = debug5
log_min_error_statement = debug5
log_min_duration_statement = -1

sudo service postgresql restart
```
  2) Now you will get tons of details of every statement, error, and even background tasks like VACUUMs
```
tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-main.log
```
  3) How to add user who executed a PG statement to log (editing `postgresql.conf`):
```
log_line_prefix = '%t %u %d %a '
```

- Check Extensions enabled in postgres: `SELECT * FROM pg_extension;`

- Show available extensions: `SELECT * FROM pg_available_extension_versions;`

## Create command

There are many `CREATE` choices, like `CREATE DATABASE __database_name__`, `CREATE TABLE __table_name__` ... Parameters differ but can be checked [at the official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/search/?u=%2Fdocs%2F9.1%2F&q=CREATE).

## Handy queries
- `SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname='__procedurename__'`: List procedure/function
- `SELECT * FROM pg_views WHERE viewname='__viewname__';`: List view (including the definition)
- `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('__table_name__'));`: Show DB table space in use
- `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('__database_name__'));`: Show DB space in use
- `show statement_timeout;`: Show current user's statement timeout
- `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename='__table_name__' AND schemaname='__schema_name__';`: Show table indexes
- Get all indexes from all tables of a schema:
```sql
SELECT
   t.relname AS table_name,
   i.relname AS index_name,
   a.attname AS column_name
FROM
   pg_class t,
   pg_class i,
   pg_index ix,
   pg_attribute a,
    pg_namespace n
WHERE
   t.oid = ix.indrelid
   AND i.oid = ix.indexrelid
   AND a.attrelid = t.oid
   AND a.attnum = ANY(ix.indkey)
   AND t.relnamespace = n.oid
    AND n.nspname = 'kartones'
ORDER BY
   t.relname,
   i.relname
```
- Execution data:
  - Queries being executed at a certain DB:
```sql
SELECT datname, application_name, pid, backend_start, query_start, state_change, state, query 
  FROM pg_stat_activity 
  WHERE datname='__database_name__';
```
  - Get all queries from all dbs waiting for data (might be hung): 
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE waiting='t'
```
  - Currently running queries with process pid:
```sql
SELECT 
  pg_stat_get_backend_pid(s.backendid) AS procpid, 
  pg_stat_get_backend_activity(s.backendid) AS current_query
FROM (SELECT pg_stat_get_backend_idset() AS backendid) AS s;
```
  - Get Connections by Database: `SELECT datname, numbackends FROM pg_stat_database;`

Casting:
- `CAST (column AS type)` or `column::type`
- `'__table_name__'::regclass::oid`: Get oid having a table name

Query analysis:
- `EXPLAIN __query__`: see the query plan for the given query
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE __query__`: see and execute the query plan for the given query
- `ANALYZE [__table__]`: collect statistics  

Generating random data ([source](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2019/07/17/postgres-tips-for-average-and-power-user/)):
- `INSERT INTO some_table (a_float_value) SELECT random() * 100000 FROM generate_series(1, 1000000) i;`

Get sizes of tables, indexes and full DBs:
```sql
select current_database() as database,
  pg_size_pretty(total_database_size) as total_database_size,
  schema_name,
  table_name,
  pg_size_pretty(total_table_size) as total_table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(table_size) as table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(index_size) as index_size
  from ( select table_name,
          table_schema as schema_name,
          pg_database_size(current_database()) as total_database_size,
          pg_total_relation_size(table_name) as total_table_size,
          pg_relation_size(table_name) as table_size,
          pg_indexes_size(table_name) as index_size
          from information_schema.tables
          where table_schema=current_schema() and table_name like 'table_%'
          order by total_table_size
      ) as sizes;
```

- [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-copy.html): Import/export from CSV to tables:
```sql 
COPY table_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ]
FROM { 'filename' | STDIN }
[ [ WITH ] ( option [, ...] ) ]

COPY { table_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ] | ( query ) }
TO { 'filename' | STDOUT }
[ [ WITH ] ( option [, ...] ) ]
```

- List all grants for a specific user
```sql
SELECT table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, privilege_type
FROM   information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE  grantee = 'user_to_check' ORDER BY table_name;
```

- List all assigned user roles
```sql
SELECT
    r.rolname,

    r.rolinherit,
    r.rolcreaterole,
    r.rolcreatedb,
    r.rolcanlogin,
    r.rolconnlimit,
    r.rolvaliduntil,
    ARRAY(SELECT b.rolname
      FROM pg_catalog.pg_auth_members m
      JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles b ON (m.roleid = b.oid)
      WHERE m.member = r.oid) as memberof, 
    r.rolreplication
FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles r
ORDER BY 1;
```

- Check permissions in a table:
```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_name='name-of-the-table';
```

- Kill all Connections:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database() AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
```

### [_CONTAINER/psql-setup/postgres-setup.md](_CONTAINER/psql-setup/postgres-setup.md)



You will install three pieces of software so that you can start using PostgreSQL. You will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows installation. Then, you will install `psql` in your Ubuntu installation. Then you will also install Postbird, a cross-platform graphical user interface that makes working with SQL and PostgreSQL better than just using the command line tool `psql`.

When you read "installation", that means the actual OS that's running on your machine. So, you have a Windows installation, Windows 10, that's running when you boot your computer. Then, when you start the Ubuntu installation, it's as if there's a completely separate computer running inside your computer. It's like having two completely different laptops.

## Installing PostgreSQL 12

To install PostgreSQL 12, you need to download the installer from the Internet. PostgreSQL's commercial company, Enterprise DB, offers installers for PostgreSQL for every major platform.

Open [https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Click the link for PostgreSQL 12 for Windows x86-64.

![Download PostgreSQL](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/download-postgresql.png)

Once that installer downloads, run it. You need to go through the normal steps of installing software.

- Yes, Windows, let the installer make changes to _my_ device.
- Thanks for the welcome. Next.
- Yeah, that's a good place to install it. Next.
- I don't want that pgAdmin nor the Stack Builder things. Uncheck. Uncheck. Next.

  ![Deselect pgAdmin 4 and Stack Builder components](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postgresql-installation-uncheck-components.png)

- Also, great looking directory. Thanks. Next.
- Oooh! A password! I'll enter **\*\*\*\***. I sure won't forget that because, if I do, I'll have to uninstall and reinstall PostgreSQL and lose all of my hard work. **Seriously, write down this password or use one you will not forget.** Next.
- Sure. 5432. Good to go. Next.
- Not even sure what that means. Default! Next.
- Yep. Looks good. Next.
- Geez. Really? Thanks. Next.
- _Time to get a tea._
- All right! All done. Finish!

## Installing PostgreSQL Client Tools on Ubuntu

Now, to install the PostgreSQL Client tools for Ubuntu. You need to do this so that the Node.js (and later Python) programs running on your Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on your Windows installation. You need to tell `apt`, the package manager, that you want it to go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package repositories. You do that by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn't running, start one.)

**Pro-tip**: Copy those commands because you're not going to type them, right? After you copy one of them, you can just right-click on the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for you.

    wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

If prompted for your password, type it.

    echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

The last line of output of those two commands running should read "OK". If it does not, try copying and pasting them one at a time.

Now that you've registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look for PostgreSQL, you need to update the `apt` registry. You should do this before you install _any_ software on Ubuntu.

    sudo apt update

Once that's finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be in the repository. Now, you can install them with the following command.

    sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common

If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it "Y".

Test that it installed by typing `psql --version`. You should see it print out information about the version of the installed tools. If it tells you that it can't find the command, try these instructions over.

## Configuring the client tools

Since you're going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your Ubuntu installation on your Windows installation, you're going to have to type that you want to access it over and over, which means extra typing. To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to always add the extra commands for you.

This assumes you're still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your Ubuntu installation uses, please follow that shell's directions for adding an alias to its startup file.

Make sure you're in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing `cd` and hitting enter. Use `ls` to find out if you have a `.bashrc` file. Type `ls .bashrc`. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it tells you that there is no file named that, then type `ls .profile`. If it shows you that one exists, that's the one you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then use the file name `.bashrc` in the following section.

Now that you know which profile file to use, type `code «profile file name»` where "profile file name" is the name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you've already added aliases, in that section), type the following.

    alias psql="psql -h localhost"

When you run `psql` from the command line, it will now always add the part about wanting to connect to _localhost_ every time. You would have to type that each time, otherwise.

To make sure that you set that up correctly, type `psql -U postgres postgres`. This tells the `psql` client that you want to connect as the user "postgres" (`-U postgres`) to the database postgres (`postgres` at the end), which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password that you used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly and you type the correct password, then you should see something like the following output.

    psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))
    Type "help" for help.

    postgres=#

Type `\q` and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.

Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don't have to specify it all the time. Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL will use to automatically send your password every time.

Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password that you want to use for your user. **Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the password that you want.** It _has_ to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn't like it when it's not.

    psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD 'password' SUPERUSER"

It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created when you installed PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you should see "CREATE ROLE".

Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into your Ubuntu shell to open Visual Studio Code and create a new file.

    code ~/.pgpass

In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for port 5432 (where PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (\*), **use your Ubuntu user name and the password that you just created for that user with the `psql` command you just typed.** (If you have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type `whoami` on the command line.) Your entry in the file should have this format.

    localhost:5432:*:«your Ubuntu user name»:«the password you just used»

For the curriculum writers' systems, it looks like this in Visual Studio Code.

![pgpass file](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/windows-pgpass-configuration.png)

Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual Studio Code.

The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so that it is only readable by your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just anyone can read and write to it. This is for _your_ security. Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did this once upon a time. Here's the command.

    chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass

You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing `ls -al ~/.pgpass`. That should return output that looks like this, **with your Ubuntu user name instead of "appacademy".**

    -rw------- 1 appacademy appacademy 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/appacademy/.pgpass

Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing `psql postgres`. Because you added the alias to your startup script, and because you created your **.pgpass** file, it should now connect without prompting you for any credentials! Type `\q` and press Enter to exit the PostgreSQL command line client.

## Installing Postbird

Head over to the [Postbird releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/releases). Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it's the only file in the list that ends with ".exe".

![Download Postbird](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/download-postbird.png)

After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from Windows that this is from an unidentified developer. If you don't want to install this, find a PostgreSQL GUI client that you do trust and install it or do everything from the command line.

![Postbird installation warning](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postbird-installation-warning.png)

You should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications aren't signed with the Microsoft Store for monetary and philosophical reasons.

Otherwise, if you trust Paxa like App Academy and tens of thousands of other developers do, then click the link that reads "More info" and the "Run anyway" button.

![Postbird run anyway](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/postbird-installation-run-anyway.png)

When it's done installing, it will launch itself. Test it out by typing the "postgres" into the "Username" field and the password from your installation in the "Password" field. Click the Connect button. It should properly connect to the running

You can close it for now. It also installed an icon on your desktop. You can launch it from there or your Start Menu at any time.

## What you did

You installed and configured PosgreSQL 12, a relational database management system, and tools to use it! Well done!

### [_CONTAINER/psql2/psql-cheat-sheet-2.md](_CONTAINER/psql2/psql-cheat-sheet-2.md)

## PSQL

Magic words:
```bash
psql -U postgres
```
Some interesting flags (to see all, use `-h` or `--help` depending on your psql version):
- `-E`: will describe the underlaying queries of the `\` commands (cool for learning!)
- `-l`: psql will list all databases and then exit (useful if the user you connect with doesn't has a default database, like at AWS RDS)

Most `\d` commands support additional param of `__schema__.name__` and accept wildcards like `*.*`

- `\?`: Show help (list of available commands with an explanation)
- `\q`: Quit/Exit
- `\c __database__`: Connect to a database
- `\d __table__`: Show table definition (columns, etc.) including triggers
- `\d+ __table__`: More detailed table definition including description and physical disk size
- `\l`: List databases
- `\dy`: List events
- `\df`: List functions
- `\di`: List indexes
- `\dn`: List schemas
- `\dt *.*`: List tables from all schemas (if `*.*` is omitted will only show SEARCH_PATH ones)
- `\dT+`: List all data types
- `\dv`: List views
- `\dx`: List all extensions installed
- `\df+ __function__` : Show function SQL code. 
- `\x`: Pretty-format query results instead of the not-so-useful ASCII tables
- `\copy (SELECT * FROM __table_name__) TO 'file_path_and_name.csv' WITH CSV`: Export a table as CSV
- `\des+`: List all foreign servers
- `\dE[S+]`: List all foreign tables
- `\! __bash_command__`: execute `__bash_command__` (e.g. `\! ls`)

User Related:
- `\du`: List users
- `\du __username__`: List a username if present.
- `create role __test1__`: Create a role with an existing username.
- `create role __test2__ noinherit login password __passsword__;`: Create a role with username and password.
- `set role __test__;`: Change role for current session to `__test__`.
- `grant __test2__ to __test1__;`: Allow `__test1__` to set its role as `__test2__`.
- `\deu+`: List all user mapping on server

## Configuration

- Service management commands:
```
sudo service postgresql stop
sudo service postgresql start
sudo service postgresql restart
```

- Changing verbosity & querying Postgres log:
  <br/>1) First edit the config file, set a decent verbosity, save and restart postgres:
```
sudo vim /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf

# Uncomment/Change inside:
log_min_messages = debug5
log_min_error_statement = debug5
log_min_duration_statement = -1

sudo service postgresql restart
```
  2) Now you will get tons of details of every statement, error, and even background tasks like VACUUMs
```
tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-9.3-main.log
```
  3) How to add user who executed a PG statement to log (editing `postgresql.conf`):
```
log_line_prefix = '%t %u %d %a '
```

- Check Extensions enabled in postgres: `SELECT * FROM pg_extension;`

- Show available extensions: `SELECT * FROM pg_available_extension_versions;`

## Create command

There are many `CREATE` choices, like `CREATE DATABASE __database_name__`, `CREATE TABLE __table_name__` ... Parameters differ but can be checked [at the official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/search/?u=%2Fdocs%2F9.1%2F&q=CREATE).

## Handy queries
- `SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE proname='__procedurename__'`: List procedure/function
- `SELECT * FROM pg_views WHERE viewname='__viewname__';`: List view (including the definition)
- `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('__table_name__'));`: Show DB table space in use
- `SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('__database_name__'));`: Show DB space in use
- `show statement_timeout;`: Show current user's statement timeout
- `SELECT * FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename='__table_name__' AND schemaname='__schema_name__';`: Show table indexes
- Get all indexes from all tables of a schema:
```sql
SELECT
   t.relname AS table_name,
   i.relname AS index_name,
   a.attname AS column_name
FROM
   pg_class t,
   pg_class i,
   pg_index ix,
   pg_attribute a,
    pg_namespace n
WHERE
   t.oid = ix.indrelid
   AND i.oid = ix.indexrelid
   AND a.attrelid = t.oid
   AND a.attnum = ANY(ix.indkey)
   AND t.relnamespace = n.oid
    AND n.nspname = 'kartones'
ORDER BY
   t.relname,
   i.relname
```
- Execution data:
  - Queries being executed at a certain DB:
```sql
SELECT datname, application_name, pid, backend_start, query_start, state_change, state, query 
  FROM pg_stat_activity 
  WHERE datname='__database_name__';
```
  - Get all queries from all dbs waiting for data (might be hung): 
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE waiting='t'
```
  - Currently running queries with process pid:
```sql
SELECT 
  pg_stat_get_backend_pid(s.backendid) AS procpid, 
  pg_stat_get_backend_activity(s.backendid) AS current_query
FROM (SELECT pg_stat_get_backend_idset() AS backendid) AS s;
```
  - Get Connections by Database: `SELECT datname, numbackends FROM pg_stat_database;`

Casting:
- `CAST (column AS type)` or `column::type`
- `'__table_name__'::regclass::oid`: Get oid having a table name

Query analysis:
- `EXPLAIN __query__`: see the query plan for the given query
- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE __query__`: see and execute the query plan for the given query
- `ANALYZE [__table__]`: collect statistics  

Generating random data ([source](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2019/07/17/postgres-tips-for-average-and-power-user/)):
- `INSERT INTO some_table (a_float_value) SELECT random() * 100000 FROM generate_series(1, 1000000) i;`

Get sizes of tables, indexes and full DBs:
```sql
select current_database() as database,
  pg_size_pretty(total_database_size) as total_database_size,
  schema_name,
  table_name,
  pg_size_pretty(total_table_size) as total_table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(table_size) as table_size,
  pg_size_pretty(index_size) as index_size
  from ( select table_name,
          table_schema as schema_name,
          pg_database_size(current_database()) as total_database_size,
          pg_total_relation_size(table_name) as total_table_size,
          pg_relation_size(table_name) as table_size,
          pg_indexes_size(table_name) as index_size
          from information_schema.tables
          where table_schema=current_schema() and table_name like 'table_%'
          order by total_table_size
      ) as sizes;
```

- [COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/sql-copy.html): Import/export from CSV to tables:
```sql 
COPY table_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ]
FROM { 'filename' | STDIN }
[ [ WITH ] ( option [, ...] ) ]

COPY { table_name [ ( column_name [, ...] ) ] | ( query ) }
TO { 'filename' | STDOUT }
[ [ WITH ] ( option [, ...] ) ]
```

- List all grants for a specific user
```sql
SELECT table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, privilege_type
FROM   information_schema.table_privileges
WHERE  grantee = 'user_to_check' ORDER BY table_name;
```

- List all assigned user roles
```sql
SELECT
    r.rolname,
    r.rolsuper,
    r.rolinherit,
    r.rolcreaterole,
    r.rolcreatedb,
    r.rolcanlogin,
    r.rolconnlimit,
    r.rolvaliduntil,
    ARRAY(SELECT b.rolname
      FROM pg_catalog.pg_auth_members m
      JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles b ON (m.roleid = b.oid)
      WHERE m.member = r.oid) as memberof, 
    r.rolreplication
FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles r
ORDER BY 1;
```

- Check permissions in a table:
```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_name='name-of-the-table';
```

- Kill all Connections:
```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database() AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
```

# Phresh 'n Clean

Wipe your hard drive clean and install your apps quickly.

[**Preparation**](https://github.com/naoki-evan-hisamoto/phresh-n-clean/blob/master/README.md#preparation) section will prevent you from losing important files, documents, and registration keys upon reinstallation.

[**Wipe + Reinstall**](https://github.com/naoki-evan-hisamoto/phresh-n-clean/blob/master/README.md#wipe--reinstall) section will walk you through installing a phresh copy of OSX.

[**Set Up**](https://github.com/naoki-evan-hisamoto/phresh-n-clean/blob/master/README.md#set-up) section will walk you through getting your phresh machine up and running as quickly as possible.

[**Application Installation**](https://github.com/naoki-evan-hisamoto/phresh-n-clean/blob/master/README.md#application-installation) section will walk you through installing your applications.

[**Tasty Treats**](https://github.com/naoki-evan-hisamoto/phresh-n-clean/blob/master/README.md#tasty-treats) section will tell you some of our Liferay team members' top picks for applications and extensions.

## Preparation

The Preparation section will prevent you from losing important files, documents, and application keys upon reinstalling OSX. The hard drive is completely erased during this process and taking the time to back up files and deauthorizing applications will ensure you have zero regrets after your phresh install.

### 1. Back Up

A fresh install of OS X will wipe any files, programs, and documents from your hard drive. Whether you use Time Machine, the Cloud, or an external hard drive, be sure to have a back up of anything you will need on your phresh machine. If you are using the cloud, make sure all files are finished syncing as well.

### 2. Deauthorize

Your computer will be viewed as a new machine after the phresh install, which means that you will want to deauthorize any applications that required a registration key. Otherwise, the same key will not work when registering a product after the wipe and you might have to jump through hoops to get your product license back.

## Wipe + Reinstall

The Wipe + Reinstall section will walk you through installing a phresh copy of OSX. When you are ready, you'll erase your hard drive and install the latest version of OSX. Once you are at this point, double-check that all necessary files, documents, pictures, and videos are backed up and all applications are deauthorized (as mentioned in the previous steps) because there is no going back after this step.

### 1. Wipe

You will be erasing your hard drive at this point. Once you have completed this step, your hard drive will be reformatted.

1. Make sure your computer is plugged into a power source.
2. `Restart` your computer and hold down `⌘ + R` as soon as the reboot starts. If successful, you will be met by the OSX Utilities screen.
3. Select **Disk Utility**, select your **Hard Drive**.
4. Select the **Erase** tab.
5. Rename your Hard Drive, select the [format](https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/erase-a-volume-dskutl14079/mac) of your Hard Drive, and select **Erase**.
6. Once the drive has been formatted, exit out of Disk Utility to return to the OSX Utilities screen.

### 2. Reinstall

Now that you have a reformatted hard drive, you will be installing a phresh copy of the latest OSX onto your hard drive (Unless you have the installation files for a different OS version on a flash drive).

1. Make sure your computer is plugged into a power source.
2. From the OSX Utilities screen select **install macOS**.
3. Select the hard drive you just reformatted in step 3 of the previous section.
4. Select **Install** and select your preferences as prompted.

## Set Up

The Set Up section will walk you through getting your phresh machine up and running as quickly as possible. We will set up the computer with Homebrew, Node, NPM, Gulp, Homebrew Cask, Git, and Github. This will prepare your computer for future processes such as installing applications quickly.

### 1. Homebrew [:link:](http://brew.sh)

Homebrew is a great tool for web developers. First, it makes removing Node very easy (otherwise you have to crawl through your file system and delete a bunch of files manually). Second, it greatly simplfies the installation of other useful packages like Git, Ruby, or the very useful wget utility.

1. Paste this into a Terminal prompt:

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

> ###### Resources

> [Homebrew Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/)
> Description from [Treehouse blog](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)

##

### 2. Node + NPM [:link:](https://www.npmjs.com)

NPM is a package manager for JavaScript and the world's largest software registry. Discover packages of reusable code — and assemble them in powerful new ways.

1. Enter `brew install node` into a Terminal prompt.
2. Enter `npm install npm@latest -g` into a Terminal prompt.
3. To check the install, enter `node -v; npm -v`. You should see two numbers print out which are the versions for node and npm respectively.

##

### 3. Gulp [:link:](https://gulpjs.com/)

gulp is a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.

1. Enter `npm install -global gulp-cli` into a Terminal prompt.
2. To check the install, enter `gulp -v`. You should see a number print out which is the version for gulp.

### [_CONTAINER/regex/regex-quick-sheet.md](_CONTAINER/regex/regex-quick-sheet.md)
Let regex;

/* shorthand character classes */
regex = /d/; // matches any digit, short for [0-9]
regex = /D/; // matches non-digits, short for [^0-9]
regex = /S/; // matches non-white space character
regex = /s/; // matches any white space character
regex = /w/; // matches character, short for [a-zA-Z_0-9]
regex = /W/; // matches non-word character [^w]
regex = /b/; // Matches a word boundary where a word character is [a-zA-Z0-9_]
These meta characters boast a pre-defined meaning and make various typical patterns easier to use.

/* matching using quantifiers */
regex= /X./; // matches any character
regex= /X*/; // Matches zero or several repetitions of letter X, is short for {0,}
regex= /X+-/; // matches one or more repetitions of letter X, is short for {1,}
regex= /X?/; // finds no or exactly one letter X, is short for is short for {0,1}.
regex= // d{3}; // matches three digits. {} describes the order of the preceding liberal
regex= // d{1,4} ; // means d must occur at least once and at a maximum of four
A quantifies helps developers to define how often an element occurs.

/* character ranges */
regex = /[a-z]/; // matches all lowercase letters
regex = /[A-Z]/; // matches all uppercase letters
regex = /[e-l]/; // matches lowercase letters e to l (inclusive)
regex = /[F-P]/; // matches all uppercase letters F to P (inclusive)
regex = /[0-9]/; // matches all digits
regex = /[5-9]/; // matches any digit from 5 to 9 (inclusive)
regex = / [a-d1-7]/; // matches a letter between a and d and figures from 1 to 7, but not d1
regex = /[a-zA-Z]/; // matches all lowercase and uppercase letters
regex = /[^a-zA-Z]/; // matches non-letters

/* matching using anchors */
regex = / ^The/; // matches any string that starts with "The"
regex = / end$/; // matches a string that ends with end
regex = / ^The end$/; // exact string match starting with "The" and ending with "End"

/* escape characters */
regex = / a/; // match a bell or alarm
regex = / e/; // matches an escape
regex = / f/; // matches a form feed
regex = / n/; // matches a new line
regex = / Q…E/; // ingnores any special meanings in what is being matched
regex = / r/; // matches a carriage return
regex = / v/; // matches a vertical tab
It is critical to note that escape characters are case sensitive

/* matching using flags */
regex = / i/; // ignores the case in pattern ( upper and lower case allowed)
regex = / m/; // multi-line match
regex = / s/; // match new lines
regex = / x/; // allow spaces and comments
regex = / j/; // duplicate group names allowed
regex = / U/; // ungreedy match
Besides the regular expressions, flags can also be used to help developers with pattern matching.

/* matching a specific string */
regex = /sing/; // looks for the string between the forward slashes 9case-sensitive)… matches "sing", "sing123"
regex = /sing/i; // looks for the string between the forward slashes (case-insensitive)... matches "sing", "SinNG", "123SinNG"
regex = /hello/g; // looks for multiple occurrences of string between the forward slashes...

/* groups */
regex = /it is (sizzling )?hot outside/; // matches "it is sizzling hot outside" and "it is hot outside"
regex = /it is (?:sizzling )?hot outside/; // same as above except it is a non-capturing group
regex = /do (dogs) like pizza 1/; // matches "do dogs like pizza dogs"
regex = /do (dogs) like (pizza)? do 2 1 like you?/; // matches "do dogs like pizza? do pizza dogs like you?"

/* look-ahead and look-behind */
regex = /d(?=r)/; // matches 'd' only if it is followed by 'r', but 'r' will not be part of the overall regex match
regex = / (?<=r)d /; // matches 'd' only if it is proceeded by an 'r', but 'r' will not be part of the overall regex match

## Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu

Test if you have Ubuntu installed by typing "Ubuntu" in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads "Type here to search". If you see a search result that reads **"Ubuntu 18.04 LTS"** with "App" under it, then you have it installed.

1.  In the application search box in the bottom bar, type "PowerShell" to find the application named "Windows PowerShell"
2.

---

---

3.  Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and choose "Run as administrator" from the popup menu

---

---

4.  In the blue PowerShell window, type the following: `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`

---

---

5.  Restart your computer

---

---

6.  In the application search box in the bottom bar, type "Store" to find the application named "Microsoft Store"

---

---

7.  Click "Microsoft Store"

---

---

8.  Click the "Search" button in the upper-right corner of the window

---

---

9.  Type in "Ubuntu"

---

---

10. Click "Run Linux on Windows (Get the apps)"

---

---

11. Click the orange tile labeled **"Ubuntu 18.04 LTS"** UBUNTU VERSION MUST BE 18.04 OR GREATER

---

---

12. Click "Install"

---

---

13. After it downloads, click "Launch"

---

---

14. If you get the option, pin the application to the task bar. Otherwise, right-click on the orange Ubuntu icon in the task bar and choose "Pin to taskbar"

---

---

15. Wait for it to install the local files

---

---

16. When prompted to "Enter new UNIX username", type your first name with no spaces

---

---

17. When prompted, enter and retype a password for this UNIX user (it can be the same as your Windows password)

---

---

18. Confirm your installation by typing the command `whoami` followed by Enter at the prompt (it should print your first name)

---

---

19. You need to update your packages, so type `sudo apt update` (if prompted for your password, enter it)

---

---

20. You need to upgrade your packages, so type `sudo apt upgrade` (if prompted for your password, enter it)

---

---

## Git

Git comes with Ubuntu, so there's nothing to install. However, you should configure it using the following instructions.

1.  Open an Ubuntu terminal if you don't have one open already.
2.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` with replacing "Your Name" with your real name.
3.  You need to configure Git, so type `git config --global user.email your@email.com` with replacing "your@email.com" with your real email.

## Google Chrome

Test if you have Chrome installed by typing "Chrome" in the search box in the bottom app bar that reads "Type here to search". If you see a search result that reads "Chrome" with "App" under it, then you have it installed. Otherwise, follow these instructions to install Google Chrome.

1.  Open Microsoft Edge, the blue "e" in the task bar, and type in [http://chrome.google.com](http://chrome.google.com/). Click the "Download Chrome" button. Click the "Accept and Install" button after reading the terms of service. Click "Save" in the "What do you want to do with ChromeSetup.exe" dialog at the bottom of the window. When you have the option to "Run" it, do so. Answer the questions as you'd like. Set it as the default browser.
2.  Right-click on the Chrome icon in the task bar and choose "Pin to taskbar".

## Node.js

Test if you have Node.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `node --version`. If it reports "Command 'node' not found", then you need to follow these directions.

1.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt update` and press Enter
2.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `sudo apt install build-essential` and press Enter
3.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash` and press Enter
4.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `. ./.bashrc` and press Enter
5.  In the Ubuntu terminal, type `nvm install --lts` and press Enter
6.  Confirm that **node** is installed by typing `node --version` and seeing it print something that is not "Command not found"!

## Unzip

For your projects you will often have to download a zip file and unzip it. It is easier to do this from the command line. So we need to install a linux unzip utility.

In the Ubuntu terminal type: `sudo apt install unzip` and press Enter

## Mocha.js

Test if you have Mocha.js installed by opening an Ubuntu terminal and typing `which mocha`. If it prints a path, then you're good. Otherwise, if it prints nothing, install Mocha.js by typing `npm install -g mocha`.

## Python 3

Ubuntu does not come with Python 3. Install it using the command `sudo apt install python3`. Test it by typing `python3 --version` and seeing it print a number.

## _Note about WSL_

As of the time of writing of this document, WSL has an issue renaming or deleting files if Visual Studio Code is open. So before doing any linux commands which manipulate files, make sure you **close** Visual Studio Code before running those commands in the Ubuntu terminal.

## Preparing your machine

The commands you need to enter are listed below. Here we will install basic developer tools, such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a 3rd party package manager for MacOS), [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) (a library of developer tools provided by Apple), VS Code (a full-featured text-editor), and Node (a JavaScript runtime environment).

### Chrome

Here at App Academy, our browser of choice is Google Chrome. This isn't super important at the beginning of the course, but once we get into frontend development (writing code that runs in a web browser) the Chrome DevTools will be crucial for debugging every manner of issue.

To install Google Chrome, download the necessary files and follow the instructions on the [Google Chrome website](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

### Xcode

Let's start with Xcode. The Xcode command line tools are a requirement for installing the homebrew package manager in the next step.

**NOTE: If you are using a Linux machine you will not be able to install Xcode or homebrew.**

Install the Xcode command line tools by running the following from the console.

    $ xcode-select --install

To conclude the installation you will need to agree to the Xcode license. Start the Xcode app, click "Agree", and allow the installation to finish. Then you can go ahead and quit the Xcode app.

### Homebrew

Homebrew is kind of like a low-tech App Store. It allows us access to and the ability to install a wide variety of software and command line tools from the console. These are distinct from those hosted on the App Store and will need to be managed by Homebrew.

Enter the following in your terminal to download and install Homebrew:

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You will be given a list of dependencies that will be installed and prompted to continue or abort. Press `RETURN` to continue.

Let's break this command down a bit. `curl`, a command-line tool commonly used for downloading files from the internet, is used to download the Homebrew installation file. The `"$(...)"` transforms the file content into a string. Finally, the string is passed to a Ruby language executable (`/usr/bin/ruby` is where the system Ruby executable file is stored on our machine) with the `-e` flag to tell Ruby to run the argument as code.

Check out the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/) to learn the basic commands.

### Node.js & NPM

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a very powerful runtime environment built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive applications like video streaming sites, robots, and other general purpose applications. For our purposes Node provides a way for us to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

We want to use a version manager with Node to help us manage potential conflicts between versions and dependencies. In this case we will be using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to install/manage Node.js.

Open up your console (the Terminal application on Mac) and run the following:

    # download and run the official install script
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash

    # update your terminal config (you will now have access to the nvm command)
    source ~/.bashrc

    # install a stable version of node
    nvm install 10.16

    # set version 10.16.0 as default version
    nvm use 10.16

    # verify install/config
    which node # => /Users/username/.nvm/versions/node/v10.16.0/bin/node

Node comes with a package manager called [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), which provides access to a whole ecosystem of libraries and tools we can use. NPM comes pre-bundled with Node, so there is no additional work for us to do. By default we don't need any additional libraries, and any additional packages we do need to use will be installed on a project-by-project basis.

### VS Code

This one is pretty easy. Go to website for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), then download and install VS Code.

To verify that the shell commands were installed correctly, run `which code` in your terminal. If `code` is not a recognized command, open the VS Code editor, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS ,`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux) and type `shell command` to find the `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH` command. Then restart the terminal. This will now allow you to easily open files in VS Code from the terminal using the `code` command followed by a file or directory.

Next, we'll want to install a few useful VS Code extensions and configure VS Code to play nice with these extensions. Download [this zip file](https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-JavaScript/js-local/setup-vs-code.zip), which contains a script that will do the work for you. Unzip the file and navigate into the directory where the file is located in the terminal (drag and drop the folder over to the terminal icon on macOS or right click in the directory and select `Open in Terminal` on most Linux distributions).

To run the script, run the command:

    ./setup-vs-code.sh

The script will do the rest. Now restart VS Code and you'll be good to go.

### Mocha testing framework

The last thing we'll be installing will be Mocha. Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that we will be using to test our work in the future. Here are the instructions of how to install `mocha`!

#### Installing Mocha

1.  Open Terminal
2.  Enter this command: `npm install -g mocha`
3.  To test your installation, run the command: `mocha --version`. If it returns a version number, you've successfully installed mocha! Otherwise, let your instructor know and they'll help you fix things.

### Installing Python3

You can just use _homebrew_ for this install, too.

    brew install python

## `.gitignore`

Before discussing how to configure webpack, be aware that running webpack and using npm creates many redundant, large files in your local project directory. To avoid this use a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory to prevent these files from being pushed to and pulled from your remote Git repositories. Create a `.gitignore` file in your project's root directory and list the files or directories you want to ignore, one per line. Use a trailing `/` to indicate a directory to ignore. To re-fetch the NPM modules, we can run `npm install`, which fetches all the modules specified in `package.json`. Then run `webpack` to regenerate the `bundle.js` and `bundle.js.map` files.

For example:

    # .gitignore

    node_modules/
    bundle.js
    bundle.js.map

You can view a full collection of useful `.gitignore` templates [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## Configuring Webpack

Just like with NPM, you can use a configuration file to set up your webpack options. You'll have to create this file by hand. It should live in your project's root directory, be named `webpack.config.js`, and export a single object.

### Specifying Entry and Output Files

`webpack.config.js` allows you to specify your entry file, and the name and location of your output file. See the example below:

    // webpack.config.js
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: "./frontend/my_app.jsx",
      output: {
          path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'app', 'assets', 'javascripts'),
          filename: "bundle.js"
      }
      ...
    };

**NB**: For Rails projects, make sure to locate your `bundle.js` file in `app/assets/javascripts` so that it's included in the Rails asset pipeline.

### Dev Tools / Source Map

`webpack.config.js` accepts a `devtool` key that can be used to enable useful tools, particularly `source-map`. A source map makes it possible for you to see the line numbers of your original source code when errors are raised. This is generally not possible because your `bundle.js` does not maintain the line numbers from the files it is bundling.

    // webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
      ...
      devtool: 'source-map',
      ...
    }

### Resolving Extensions

`webpack.config.js` also accepts a `resolve` key, which lets you specify what file extensions to process without explicitly naming them.

    // webpack.config.js

    module.exports = {
      ...
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '*']
      },
      ...
    };

You must include the star matcher `'*'` to be able to include files with an explicit extension. Otherwise `require('file_name.js')` will cause webpack to look for `file_name.js.js`.

    // webpack.config.js
    var path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      entry: './frontend/entry.jsx',
      output: {
        filename: './bundle.js',
      },
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            test: [/\.jsx?$/],
            exclude: /(node_modules)/,
            use: {
              loader: 'babel-loader',
              query: {
                presets: ['@babel/env', '@babel/react']
              }
            },
          }
        ]
      },
      devtool: 'source-map',
      resolve: {
        extensions: ['.js', '.jsx', '*']
      }
    };

*Note: It is no longer necessary to enable developer mode for Windows Subsystem Linux to work.*  

## Getting Windows Ready

1) Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) is **not** automatically enabled on windows. So, to start off, we need to enable it!

    a. Go to your Windows Search bar and type in `turn windows features on or off`  

    b.  Click on the result that matches your query. It will be in your Control Panel.  You should see something like this:

   ![toggle windows features](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/turn-windows-features-on-or-off.png)

   c. Scroll down until you see "Windows Subsystem for Linux" - ensure its box
   is checked!

   ![wsl checkbox](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-turnon.png)  

   d. Scroll up a bit until you see "Virtual Machine Platform." Turn this
   feature on as well.

   ![virtual machine platform checkbox](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-virtual-machine-platform.png)  

   > **Note:** The "Virtual Machine Platform" was added in a February 2020
   > update to Windows. If your computer has not received this update, this
   > feature may not be available. In this case, just make sure "Windows
   > Subsystem for Linux" is enabled and continue on. Keep in mind that if you
   > update, you may need to go back and enable this feature.

2)  **Restart your computer**

3)  Check your Windows 10 version by going to `System Information` and checking your Version. If your build is earlier than 16215, skip step 4 and proceed to step 5.  

   ![windows version](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/windows-version.png)

4)  Open up Microsoft Store. Search for "Ubuntu"
    1) Choose "Ubuntu" (not 16.04 LTS or 18.04 LTS)  


![ubuntu choice in microsoft store](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/ubuntu-choice.png)    

5) If you run into errors or if you have an early version of Windows 10, see further information  [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)  

6) Open up the Ubuntu app. Follow the prompts, which will include making a username and password. Don't forget your password!  

   ![open ubuntu](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/open-ubuntu.png)  


Note: if you get an error at this step, see FAQ below.

## Start Outfitting your new Linux Subsystem: RVM / Ruby, learn-co, git, NodeJS, and Rails

7) Once everything is set up, we can start setting up our system! Start off by running the following to download our dependencies:


  ```
  sudo apt-get update  
  ```

  ```
  sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev libpq-dev libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake libtool bison gnupg postgresql postgresql-contrib
  ```

8) Install RVM by running:

  ```
  gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  ```

  > __Note:__ There are two possible errors you may see at this point. Follow the appropriate instructions below:

  > **(A) If** the previous command does not work the first time (with the error `keyserver receive failed: No dirmngr` and/or `IPC connect call failed`, try running it again.
  >  If the second time works, you should see public keys imported by Piotr Kuczynski and Michal Papis. You can now continue with the procedure and disregard the rest of the instructions in this shaded area.
  >  If the command still does not work (you still get the same errors as the first attempt), then perform the following:
  >
  > ```
  > sudo apt-get install gnupg2 -y
  > gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  > ```
  >
  > **(B) If** the original error you get is `[gpg] keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure`, run the following command (following the instructions above if you get the error above):
  > ```
  > gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net:80 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
  > ```

  Once you have successfully run either the `gpg` or the `gpg2` command above, run the following:

  ```
  \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
  ```
  
  When RVM finishes installing, close out of Ubuntu entirely and reopen it to make sure RVM is running.

9)  Next, to set up a ruby version most compatible with Learn.co labs, we want to download ruby 2.6.1 and set it as our default:

  ```
  rvm install 2.6.1
  rvm use 2.6.1 --default
  ```

10)  Let's install the bundler gem:  

  ```
  gem install bundler
  ```

11) And set up git:

  ```
  git config --global color.ui true
  ```

  For the next few commands, make sure to input your specific information:

  ```
  git config --global user.name "your_name"
  ```

  ```
  git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
  ```

  You can either communicate with your remote repositories via HTTPS or SSH. If you want to use SSH (which means you will not have to authenticate with your GitHub username and password before each push) - [follow these instructions.](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/)

12) Now we can get set up with the learn-co gem. This will allow you to use commands like `learn`, `learn submit`, and `learn open`.

  ```
  gem install learn-co
  ```
  
  - In your browser:
    - If you have connected your Github account to your Learn account, navigate to learn.co/your_github_username
    - If you have not connected your Github account: Go to [your profile](https://learn.co/account/profile) > Learn Settings > Public Profile. Click on the link under **Username**
  - At the bottom of the page, you should see text that says `OAuth Token:` followed by a token. Copy the token, and then go back to your WSL terminal
  - Type:

      ```
      learn whoami
      ```

  - Paste in your token  

  You should now be fully authenticated with learn.

13) Now let's get Node Version Manager, NodeJS, and Rails installed so we can make a bunch of stuff!

  - First, install NVM:

    ```
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
    ```
  
  - Then, reload bash profile into current session:

    ```
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  
  - Next, install NodeJS:

    ```
    nvm install node
    ```
  
  - Now, Ruby on Rails:

    ```
    gem install rails
    ```

## Choose your programming editor: VSCode

You can use any editor you want, but I am going to be walking through setting up VSCode.

14) Download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Choose the Windows download, not the Linux download. Any required Linux downloads will be done via the Ubuntu terminal, and everything else should be downloaded for your Windows OS.

15) To configure your Ubuntu terminal to be available in VSCode:

  - open up VSCode
  - open the Command Palette via `F1` or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`p`
  - begin typing the following: `Terminal: Select Default Shell`  until you see it. Select that option.

  ![command palette](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/default-shell.png)  

   - Once you select it, a few options will pop up. You want to select WSL

  ![WSL Terminal](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/wsl-bash-selection.png)

16) Now, you can use your Ubuntu terminal in VSCode. Select "New Terminal" in the "Terminal" drop-down, or type `Ctrl`+`Shift`+` in order to use it!

17) Additional User Settings *(OPTIONAL)*:
  - You can add a few things to your User Settings to customize and improve your programming experience. Most importantly, we can make VSCode treat .erb files like .html files, allowing us to use all the same shortcuts and get the same syntax highlighting.
  - To open up user settings, again open up the Command Palette using `F1` or `Ctr`+`Shift`+`p` and type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`

  ![Preferences - settings](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/settings-json.png)
    
  - You will see a screen like this:

  ![Preferences - settings](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/user-settings.png)

  - To have your erb files treated like html, add the following to your user settings (circled above):
      
      ```
      "emmet.includeLanguages": {
          "erb": "html"
      }
      ```

  - Some optional personal preferences that I like:

      ```
      "window.zoomLevel": -1,
      "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off",
      "editor.fontSize": 11,
      "editor.fontFamily": "Hack, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace",
      ```
         
  - Note that for the Hack font to be usable, you have to download it. You can check it out [here](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).

18) Update your .learn-config
  - Travel to your Linux home directory by typing `cd`, you can change your .learn-config by typing:

    ```
    nano .learn-config
    ```

  - and customizing where you want the ```learn open``` command to save labs, and setting your editor to VSCode. Here's what it should look like:

    ```
    ---
    :learn_directory: "/mnt/c/users/<your username>/dev/flatiron/labs"
    :editor: code
    ```

  - You save a file you have modified in `nano` by following the directions at the bottom of the screen: click `Ctrl`+`X` and then `y` and then `Enter` to save your changes.

  - If you feel uncomfortable with these commands, check out the basic Linux commands link below in the resources.

## Important Knowledge: Basic Use

Your terminal is actually accessing an Ubuntu Virtual Machine which is running inside of your Windows OS. If you ever ```cd``` in your terminal, you will be sent to the 'user home' of your Linux VM. That is also the default location you will be in when you open your Ubuntu app. You actually want to do all of your business inside of your normal Windows file space, not your Linux VM file space. So, you will need to know how to navigate in your terminal from your Ubuntu file system to your Windows file system. This is pretty simple if you understand how the system is set up, so let's go over that quickly.

To allow you to access the functionality of a Linux machine, Windows stores the Ubuntu OS and file system inside of its own file system. You should NEVER access your Ubuntu files via your Windows machine. What you SHOULD do is save everything you are working on in your normal Windows filespace, and access that via your Ubuntu terminal. So, how do you do that? Well, from the Ubuntu's point of view, it is just a normal Linux machine, but Microsoft has made a pathway between the Linux VM and your Windows OS via the `/mnt` directory in your Ubuntu's root.

Here is a quick visual of what the first few levels of any Linux filesystem look like:  
![linux file system](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/linux_fs.png)

As you can see, the `mnt` directory is made for other filesystems, so that is where Microsoft connected your Linux to your Windows machine:

![linux file system](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/linux_fs_path.png)

So, you can get there from your starting point by typing:

```
cd /mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
```
or
```
cd ../../mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
```

Remember, put all of your stuff in your windows directories! That way, you have access to it via your Linux Terminal or your Windows OS, and your VSCode editor can open to the correct location when you use
```
code .
```
(if you are in your Linux file system, VSCode will open, but not to the right spot).

## Adding A Flatiron Customization To Your Terminal

Start out by ensuring you're back in the Linux home directory, with `cd ~` or just `cd`.

Then, make a backup for your `.bashrc`

```
mv .bashrc .bashrc.bak
```

We will want a tool for converting Windows ending to Unix endings for our new `.bashrc`

```
sudo apt-get install dos2unix
```

download the new `.bashrc`

```
curl -R "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Enoch2k2/flatiron-wsl-bashrc/master/.bashrc" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

We'll use our converter to convert our bashrc to use the right unix endings:

```
dos2unix .bashrc
```
## Set up a directory for all of your labs

You'll notice that we set up our `.learn-config` file earlier with a path destination of `/mnt/c/users/<your_windows_username>/dev/flatiron/labs`. The `.bashrc` file we just downloaded gives us a really nice way to access that folder quickly by just typing in `labs` when we pull up our WSL terminal (or anytime you want to access that folder - it doesn't matter what directory you are currently in when you type it). In order for this to work, we need to make sure that these directories exist. To do this, begin by navigating to your `windows home` directory:

```
cd /mnt/c/users/your_windows_username
```
Now, let's make the appropriate files. Run these one at a time, and do it without copying and pasting. Remember the basic bash commands: `cd` changes directories to whatever folder you type in and `mkdir` creates a new directory which will be a subdirectory of the current directory location of your terminal.

```
mkdir dev
cd dev
mkdir flatiron
cd flatiron
mkdir labs
```
Now you have the directories you need, and you should have seen yourself navigating down your new file tree as you made each new directory and then `cd`'d into it.


Now, `learn open` should work seamlessly by adding your most current lab to the `labs` directory we just made.

Also, you should be able to run the command
```
labs
```
at any time in your terminal and you will be taken to your `labs`  directory. Give it a try!


## Phantomjs

In the Javascript section of the Flatiron curriculum, some tests require phantomjs. If you run across an error related to phantomjs, do the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential chrpath libssl-dev libxft-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libfontconfig1-dev -y
cd ~
export PHANTOM_JS="phantomjs-2.1.1-linux-x86_64"
wget https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs/releases/download/v2.1.1/$PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2
sudo tar xvjf $PHANTOM_JS.tar.bz2
sudo mv $PHANTOM_JS /usr/local/share
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/share/$PHANTOM_JS/bin/phantomjs /usr/local/bin
phantomjs --version
```  


## Advanced topics: PostgreSQL setup (OPTIONAL)

**Setting up PostgreSQL allows simple production-level database integration into a Rails project. This allows easy hosting on Heroku with only a little setup.**

1) First, we want to [Download PostgreSQL for Windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) - download the Interactive Installer.
2) Once everything is downloaded and installed, you can verify proper operation by typing in your terminal

  ```
  psql -p 5432 -h localhost -U postgres
  ```

  once connection is verified, you can quit by typing
  
  ```
  \q
  ```

3) There are a few ways to do the next few steps but the easiest way is to use pgAdmin. Open up pgAdmin, which is a Graphical User Interface for PostgreSQL.

![PGAdmin in start](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/pgadmin-start.png)

 - This should open up pgAdmin in your browser. Start a server by right-clicking "PostgreSQL" and selecting "Connect Server"

![PostgreSQL selection](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/start-server.png)
![PostgreSQL connect](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/connect-server.png)

 - Enter the password you defined during the download
 - Your PostgreSQL server is running, and can now be integrated into your projects.
 - You also want to set up a new user/role and password that you want to use with your rails app. Ensure you give your user/role all available permissions during setup.
    - During setup, ensure to fill out `Name` in the `General` tab, `Password` in the `Definition` tab, and enable all permissions in the `Privileges` tab.

![create user](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/pgadmin-create-user.png)  

![create user permissions](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/create-user-permissions.png)

  **EXAMPLE: CONNECTING YOUR POSTGRESQL SERVER TO YOUR RAILS APP**

  - Make sure your server is connected and roles are configured as described above.
  - Make sure you are in a suitable directory (in your Windows file system space) and create a Rails app configured to use PostgreSQL:
    ```
    rails new my-first-app --database=postgresql
    ```    

- Now, let's configure our `database.yml` file to allow our app to connect to our database. Add the following to your `config/database.yml` file under BOTH `development:` and `test:` You will need to add a user and password which will correspond to the roles we created in pgAdmin.

    ```
    host: localhost
    user: your-postgres-username
    password: your-postgres-usernames-password
    ```
- We can now test our database and rails interoperability by first setting up some architecture in our app:

    ```
    rails g scaffold Post title:string body:text
    ```
- now create and migrate a database:

    ```
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    ```

- If these fail, ensure you have added your database.yml configurations under both the development AND test sections

- Now, start a server:
    ```
    rails s
    ```
- If you navigate to `localhost:3000` you should see that we are on Rails!  
  ![on Rails](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/on-rails.png)
- Let's test our database by going to 'localhost:3000/posts'   
  ![posts](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/posts.png)
- Now just follow the crud links and try to make a post! We should be seeing our database working great with our rails app!

![database works](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/database-works.png)

- Hopefully, everything is working for you! Now you're ready to develop using WSL!

## FAQ

If you get the error: `Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions. Distributions can be installed by visiting the Windows Store: https://aka.ms/wslstore Press any key to continue...`

1. Search for 'Services' in your Windows search bar, open it up  

![find services ](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/setup-instructions/find_services.png)

2. Scroll down to the `L` section, and find `LxssManager`. If it is running, right click and `Restart` it. If it is not running, right click it and `Start` it.
